#1 get asm output from IDA to assemble
#2 decide which libraries to use, and setup the project
#3 rewrite unportable parts of assembly
#4 possibly write additional routines
#5 integrate all, compile, win :)


goal #1:
- IDA output itself isn't assemble-able, we will have to write converter
- assembler of choice - NASM
- write Python script to convert IDA output to NASM syntax
- it is possible that we will also use the script to partition IDA output into
  more units (will be more manageable and lower assembly time, separation could
  be done by addresses - put certain ranges to certain files)

goal #2:
- SDL2 library has been selected for this honorable job
- now conquering introductory tutorials and making hello world app
- find or create object-oriented wrappers


07.09.2015.
- 3 whole weeks have gone by, and the parser is at about 75%.

15.09.2015.
- Parser is finished! Phase #1 completed, in a bit more than 4 weeks. On to
  deciding on libraries (most likely SDL) and setting up Visual Studio project.

03.11.2015.
- Resuming work after finishing with ESET stuff (or so I thought).

20.02.2016.
- SDL2 hello world set up, with SDL2pp.

03.05.2016.
- Switched to new NASM - assembling is way faster + it revealed a bug in the
  parser - variables of struct type were incorrectly outputted as db <size>
  instead of times <size> db 0.
- Fixed some out of range constants in IDA (IDA seems to make out of range
  negative numbers).

15.07.2016.
- work is taking up lot of time, but finally got around to do some improvements; some parser errors fixed,
  VC project fixed, now making a parser for input symbol list
- parser mostly written; having problems with debug symbols -- NASM might be generating them incorrectly,
  and SDL libs might only be missing PDB's
- what's also left is to need to generate SWOS header from symbols file

24.10.2016.
- ran into big problem, linker was reporting that debug symbols were corrupt... nothing I did helped, so I'm
  recreating the project, test project seems to work fine

03.12.2017.
- change of plan: I couldn't bring myself to fix debug symbols problem all this time... (by writing C++ version of
  alink), however I am now trying to write a parser converter for MASM, but in C++, since Python version was painfully
  slow (about 2 minutes to convert)... let's see how this goes!

03.01.2018.
- working on rewriting IDA ASM parser in C++, and making it super-fast
- learning CMake to rewrite the project in it

17.03.2018.
- CMake is dropped, replaced by Meson build
- trying to create fastest possible browser in C++, creating code generator in Python
- it's hard to get motivation

08.04.2018.
- actually managed to do a lot and regain focus and motivation (no idea how :P)

09.04.2018.
- had to do [commercial] work, so a small break shall we say

14.06.2018.
- finally got the working parser v2 :) it's *extremely* fast (about 30-40ms :D), and uses MASM for assembling,
  which does it really fast as well (seems NASM implementation is garbage) + parser v2 breaks input into multiple
  files allowing parallel assembly to go on
- now I will start putting the project together in terms of building, Meson leaves a lot to be desired,
  but in essence does the job
- next milestone will be combining everything together in a compilable project, and running a hello world ;)

20.06.2018.
- it's all linked, and invoking SWOS code in win32 for the first time :)
- my patience with Meson is done, as well as build systems in general, switch to plain simple VS project

01.07.2018.
- game finally started working a little bit :) (sadly it crashes randomly); but menus are mostly working
  no fixed plan currently, will just chip away at it, and work on it bit by bit

16.09.2018.
- game play is perfect ;) now I'm writing menu compiler in Python, I want to recreate options menu, and later start
  adding SWOS++ features

02.10.2018.
- menu compiler works awesome, I'm writing menu scripts and adding new functionality; once the menus are fairly
  complete I can dedicate to fixing career bugs (perhaps in parallel to adding SWOS++ functionality, we'll see
  how things work out)
