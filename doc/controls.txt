There are several available options to control the menu and the team during
the game:
- keyboard (2 simultaneous players can use it with separate key configurations)
- mouse (just 1 available)
- game controller (any recognized controller connected to the system is
                   available, one per player)

Controls can be set up in details from Controls menu, reachable from the
Options menu.

Controls Menu

- controls menu contains maximum 4 elements, if there are more selectable controls than that, arrows
  should show up, and entries can be scrolled
- entries are light blue, and the selected entry is purple
- there is always at least one entry selected
- configure controls buttons should only be enabled for joysticks/keyboards
- selecting mouse controls should unselect other player's mouse, if selected
- redefine keys menu should be exitable by clicking a mouse
- at the end of redefining keys prompt is controlled by keys: y - accepts choice, n - clears the choice and starts
  over, q - quits to previous menu without changing anything
- q is an additional option compared to SWOS++
- if the keyboard isn't properly configured (some of the keys are null), redefine keys dialog will
  be automatically shown -- in this keys user is not allowed to quit

Joysticks

- individual joystick can be tracked by GUID
- individual joystick settings are tracked via GUID, and they are button indices (fire/bench)
  and dead zones
- GUIDs of selected joysticks are saved, and an attempt is made to restore them on the next run
- at startup default keys should be assigned if any of the keys is missing/invalid
- if joystick is selected for one player that the other one is using, the other player should be stripped of
  this joystick, if any other joystick exists it should be selected, if not, default for player 1 is
  keyboard and for player 2 no controls; if joystick fails to open, other one should be tried (if any),
  until one succeeds, if none can open fall-back to defaults
- auto-connect joypads is suspended at start-up, it only works later in game
- when auto-connecting joysticks, assign it to the player that has no joystick selected, try player 2,
  then player 1, if both are using joysticks, overwrite the one that was added earlier

Play Match

- when starting a game, controls for the team will be determined by the controller that pressed fire on "PLAY MATCH"
  menu entry
- if a controller has already been selected for the previous team, nothing should happen (it should be quietly
  ignored)
- fire from any joypad connected to the system is accepted (any button really)
- after player 1 has selected their team, those controls will be inactive while player 2 sets up their team
