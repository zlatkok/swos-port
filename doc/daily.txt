- finished custom step of Meson build
- refactored script a little
- working on enabling test of TookenLookup.cpp
19.03.2018.
- fixed invalid token lookup test generator dependency
- trying to get generated token lookup to compile with the tester
20.03.2018.
- managed to compile null tester
- had to change TokenLookup into header instead of cpp file so Meson would stop compiling it
- trying to create actual tester implementation

- working on tester implementation
01.04.2018.
/
02.04.2018.
- improved tester a bit
03.04.2018.
- implemented test string output (print string split into lines)
04.04.2018.

05.04.2018.

06.04.2018.
- properly implemented output of test string and test tokens
- got to a point where actual tester function needs to be written
07.04.2018.
- fixed a bug in test tokens output
- tester dummy compiled correctly!
- continuing with tester implementation, switched to raw multi-line strings where applicable
- tester basic function compiled for the first time!
08.04.2018.
- fixed tester crashing :)
- passed tests?!?! IMPOSSIBRU!!
- finished std lib lookup function, setting up performance test
09.04.2018.
- implemented custom hash function
- lookup generator + performance tests FINITO!!! RAWR!
- Meson is retarded, doesn't allow access to output from the tests >< (there's a not a very good workaround)
- found out about gperf & the other tool
- successfully added gperf to build, and verified that it is slower (albeit only slightly)
- other tool is a bit slower than gperf so skipping it (only advantage is it's 100% in C++)
- now creating Meson build for ida2asm, in order to have fully functional Visual Studio project
10.04.2018.
- had to modify Python script to accommodate retarded Meson's hard-coded expectancy about output file locations
- got up to the rest of the parser now, trying to get it compiled
11.04.2018.
- Meson build done, even though it's buggy for VS (doesn't rebuild when Python script changes)
- ida2asm successfully compiled!
- and it's not crashing anymore! :)
12,13.04.2018.
- working on parser, solid progress, hope to finish struct parsing soon
- enable tokenizer to recognize and report numbers
14.04.2018.
- switched build to x86 (was x64), it can only be done when running Meson from x86 set up VS command prompt
- did some testing, and IFs turn out to be slightly faster than SWITCH (tables probably mess up the cache)
- switched to custom isspace that's 10x faster than the one from std lib (wtf)
- added support for parsing numbers, and debugged it
- in the light of recent changes gperf seems to slightly overperform the state machine
15.04.2018.
- after some changes state machine is beating gperf again :)
- improved custom hash by using binary search, now it's outperforming std::unordered_map in release too
- implemented state machine using ifs instead of switches, but it's just slightly slower
- fixed some bugs in parsing
16.04.2018.
- debugging parser and struct assembling code, getting more quirks resolved
17.04.2018.
- re-consolidated struct handling code
- fixed test (broken with new changes and optimizations)
18.04.2018.
- tested tokens with alignment, almost no difference, it even feels negligibly slower
- made lookupToken return hash for id's as well, performance hit is small
- implemented HashMap to store defines
19.04.2018.
- moved hash function to util and turned it into constexpr; however it came with a big performance hit due to
  recursion, so I made constexpr a second version to use for static strings
- made a template so I can just call constHash("some str") and everything is handled perfectly :)
- fixed includes, Meson already includes directories of generated files automatically
- code to catch custom hash collisions was buggy :) but I don't wanna bother finding collision-free function
- moved parseInt() to Token, it was much more natural fit
- now parsing dot directives
- started work on labels

- planned on adding instructions and 'output lines' in general
03.05.2018.
- worked on expanding parser with [,],comma,+,-,* (will need it for parsing instructions)
04.05.2018.
- finally passed tests with parser extensions
- trying to create some sort of instruction parsing/storing skeleton
05.05.2018.
- worked on instruction storage implementation
06.05.2018.
- working on instruction parsing & related stuff
- added register size field
07.05.2018.
- continuing work on instructions, came up with an idea to use placement new
08.05.2018.
- refactored instructions, used placement new (sooo much better now!), continuing work on parsing
09.05.2018.
/
10.05.2018.
/
11.05.2018.
- attempt to change Token into full fledged class failed miserably
12.05.2018.
- added single-quoted string to tokenizer
13.05.2018.
- a bit of work on data item parsing
14.05.2018.
/
15.05.2018.
- close to finishing data item parsing (for now)
16.05.2018.
- worked on adding dup() support to tokenizer (sheesh)
17.05.2018.
- changed the way number parsing works
- refactored lot of code, it's shorter and more clear now
- finally passed all test with parser dup() extension
- after all the changes it's 25% faster!!! (and I wasn't optimizing at all) :)
- initial collecting of data items seems to work fine
18.05.2018.
- added some cool templates to OutputItem ;)
- eliminated size inside output items themselves, only keeping it at outer output item container
- it occurred to me to run static analysis, it uncovered couple of interesting things
- parsed function local variables and arguments
19.05.2018.
- instructions can have THREE operands... gah, fixing that
- save the comments from ignored entities
- parsing passed for the first time!!
- changed struct parsing code to use placement new as well (ended up with more compact and clear code)
- turned size_t to explicit size type where mattered
- starting work on output machinesZ, for now verbatim (copy input as is) to verify parsing
20.05.2018.
- added measurement of the time whole program took to execute
- made output hierarchy, went into details, file opening, reading into buffer etc.
- added #pragma pack where needed, we were using sizeof() which was returning the size with padding
  (and I later assumed no padding when copying data)
21.05.2018.
- fixed a bug in calculating struct size, a bit of progress in verbatim output
22.05.2018.
- struct output is done & correct!! :)
23.05.2018.
- added support for precompiled headers
- defines outputted correctly!! :)
- filtered original swos.asm in the same way as ida2asm, I can diff like a boss now ;)
24.05.2018.
- set up skeleton for instructions output and outputted some basic elements
- replaced all that ugly duplicated code for size assertion with a cool template
- restructured instruction handling code but now it's crashing... ugh... too late to continue
25.05.2018.
- improved instruction processing a bit, but it's still not working properly
26.05.2018.
- improved instruction processing, it's almost there :) just a few more glitches, I hope :)
27.05.2018.
- turned + into strictly binary operator (numbers can't start with it), since IDA uses it ambiguously (& fixed tests)
- missed that variable after "offset" part can also have its offset ;)
- implemented stack variables output
- implemented data items output
- discovered junk chars in strings... sigh... handled those and added tests as well
- they have a char constant: '\'... >_<
- verbatim output is now close enough! :)
28.05.2018.
- tried assembling with TASM but _no chance_
- set up output class hierarchy to share output code efficiently
- haha MASM swallowed up structs :)
- as well as defines! took some friendly persuasion (ie. editing names in IDA), MASM is picky about keywords
29.05.2018.
- implemented mechanism for removing unneeded procs via a text file (this will be expanded later)
- fixed instruction parameter spacing in output
- fixed a bug when some new lines ended up being non-Windows (\r got eaten)
- gah... found out that stupid MASM needs a command line argument to be case-insensitive
- worked around MASM bug (or *extremely* undocumented area), whereas it seems impossible to initialize an array of
  structures containing array of other structures
30.05.2018.
- MASM regards any label inside proc as local, while IDA doesn't and calls them liberally, so worked around that by
  turning each non-anonymous label inside proc into an empty proc (nested proc's are OK)
- included "assume" into output (since MASM needs it)
- started working on parallelized parser (which should break input file to many separate files too)
31.05.2018.
- worked on breaking parsing into threads... unsuccessfully
01.06.2018.
- implemented parsing units
- implemented error reporting system for parsing units
02.06.2018.
- fixed comments being left out when determining chunk borders (as well as segments)
- set up output system for parsing units
03.06.2018.
- fixed invalid output file forming if only a path without filename is given
- now workers only output disassembly and structs & defines go separately
- wrote a Perl script for creating a cleaned up version of swos.asm for testing if everything's in order
- fixed errors in determining limits of input file chunks
- fixed error in parsing directives with comments
- fixed empty lines at starts of output files
- fixed invalid line numbers when reporting parsing errors
04.06.2018.
- set up string set class to hold references
- decided to go with generic map
- learned that externs require type for MASM, need to redesign solution
05.06.2018.
- implemented generic StringMap template, and wired it to defines (seems to work! :))
- redesigned a bit StringMap and StringSet, added range for loop support, it's cleaner now with less code repetitions
- they can also change size and reallocate now (although we don't want them to do that)
- did some refactoring on asm converter worker, it's much nicer now
- finished reference resolving, but it's untested :)
06.06.2018.
- resolved all externs and publics, sent it to output... but it's not working :)
07.06.2018.
- debugging externs resolving
08.06.2018.
- more debugging of externs resolving
- did a bit of refactoring, const Token is used in sooo many places, so aliased it with CToken
09.06.2018.
- did some research on SWOS palettes (unrelated to this project ;))
- finally output is done without triggering any assertions :P
- got the script for assembling all output files going, fixing all the errors
- everything assembled without an error???
- researched on raylib vs SDL, will go with SDL after all
10.06.2018.
- reverted StringMap<T>::Node to private, now iterator returns special struct type with all the necessary data
- removed duplicate references, seems like it slightly improved performance
- implemented move constructor for StringView
- it's not assembling anything... object files are 230 bytes long...
- I was happy too soon :) include had "end" in it so the assembly stopped before any real output
11.06.2018.
- move segments to labels before resolving references to help cache
- finally fixed bugs in extern matching, now line numbers in MASM errors work again! :)
- however, we're back to fixing assembling errors due to MASM idiosyncrasies
12.06.2018.
- fixed redefined Amiga registers
- fixed broken reference duplicate removal
- switched to MASM 8.0; some errors disappeared :D
- fixed invalid prefix error
13.06.2018.
- removed char * and void * operators from String class, it's safer and more efficient now
- added workaround for weird IDA behaviour of not marking initialized structs with data as struct variables
- added guaranteed EOF token to the end of each unit
- added support for deleting range of functions from the assembly
- so far pieces 2, 3, 4, 7 & 8 are assembling fully!
14.06.2018.
- fixed quoted string parsing, I assumed it would work same as in C, but I was completely wrong
- piece 6 and 1 assembling correctly!
- turns out "assume" directives were causing MASM to freak out and add cs: prefix to almost every instruction :P
  (this made some short jumps fall out of range and cause errors)
- it all REALLY assembled correctly this time!!!
- it's linking _without a single_ warning, whew!
15.06.2018.
- plotted out plan for building the whole thing
- went and manually built SDL2 and belonging libraries
16.06.2018.
- will compile libs manually and just use the resulting lib files (with debug versions as well)
- fixed couple of bugs in ida2asm
- fighting with Meson again
17.06.2018.
- build systems are shit, gonna write my own script
18.06.2018.
/
19.06.2018.
/
20.06.2018.
- gave up on writing script, making Visual Studio project and that's it
- great day, it's all linked together and actually correctly invoking SWOS code!!! :)))
21.06.2018.
- added capability to replace asm functions with imports from C++ to ida2asm
- making ida2asm generate swos.h, better to keep it all in one place
22.06.2018.
- finished symbol file parsing code
- added possibility to remove variables from assembly too (not just procs)
- removed bunch of useless crap and rerouted SWOS() into C++ :)
23.06.2018.
- fixed export needed by C++ not turning up in publics list if it wasn't needed as public in asm
- implemented a nice templatized class to deal with nasty conversions involved with 68k registers ;)
- advancing toward initial image scrolling
24.06.2018.
- collapsed consecutive anonymous data items to 'x dup(y)' form (shaved of ~300kb and should speed up assembling)
- fixed some invalid code, refactored source a little, made it a bit nicer
  (learned that fread() has max read count that it accepts, 1mb = OK, 10mb = FAIL)
- worked on initial image scrolling, will need palette settings & flipping for this
- SDL is so under-documented, will need to figure out a reliable way to do 70FPS precise enough, as well as
  fast way to scale up to at least 640x480
25.06.2018.
- reading docs, trying to figure out how to get 320x200x8 buffer to the screen (efficiently)
26.06.2018.
- managed to draw intro scrolling images, but palette for two.256 comes out wrong :(
27.06.2018.
- ida2asm now reports if any symbol from symbols.txt wasn't found in the asm file
- allowed data items to spawn ranges too
- drew a menu :) but still can't move cursor
28.06.2018.
- added code for keyboard handling (but it's not working)
- enabled ShowMenu
- had crashes in menu drawing functions, turned out to be caused by some SWOS functions destroying registers
  VC++ expects not to change across function calls; modified ida2asm, added generation of push/pop instructions
  to save and restore those registers and that set it straight
- seems like MASM uses nops (0x90) for alignment instead of zeros in data segment, had a string lose ending zero
  terminator because of it, will need to be more careful since retarded MASM can't be instructed which value to use
- implemented natvis file (debugger instructions) for my custom classes, it works great now
29.06.2018.
- added support for hooking functions (inject call to our function on entry)
- placed replaced symbols into SWOS namespace
- some small refactoring
- discovered that the crash outside IDE was due to joypad controls which weren't patched
- implemented directory listing
- implemented log file
- added macro for invoking SWOS procs with relevant registers preserved (esi is especially problem, since it's used
  in so many places), release version used some registers that got clobbered and crashed
- integrated crash reporter
- finished Bash script for creating backups
30.06.2018.
- fixed palette problem, I'm the retard :D only copied 256 bytes instead of 768
- fixed bug in ida2asm where a data belonging to a menu that landed between the chunks got lost (will detect and
  report it if it ever happens again)
- fixed initial cross fade from images to menu
- added 68k register values to crash report
- implemented text input and made hooks bit more elegant and general
- figured out why it's crashing on Playa's machine: MASM is treating variables as pointers within procs in data
  segment... on my machine it works randomly but overwrites memory all over the place
  fixed it by temporarily switching to cseg if proc isn't inside it
01.07.2018.
- fixed highlights not loading in release mode (LoadFile needs to set zero flag even though it's the only outcome)
- removed int 3 at start from DIYLeagueTournamentMatch (bah)
- fixed a bug in ida2asm's collapsing of contiguous anonymous data items... was only comparing their value but
  not the size... yikes!
- fixed not being able to close program while fading (process events on each palette change)
- added synchronization, not perfect but seems OK for now
- fixed lost leading comments on data items
- fixed errors in stdlib fopen(), seems it didn't like unaligned stack, SWOS was pushing a word, made it push
  dword always
- fixed crash before the game, LoadFile() wasn't returning size in D1 per specification, so a low number was inside,
  causing sprite fixup to be done only partially
02.07.2018.
- fixed a bug in log functions (it was choosing va_list variant over ... for 1 argument, had to rename to logv)
- did some timing experiments (unsuccessfully, it's still too slow/fast, but I'll check swpe it had good sync)
03.07.2018.
- fixed fade out to black from stadium menu when starting the game
04.07.2018.
- debugged in-game crash, I thought pitch memory is maybe getting overwritten, tested it with OllyDbg memory range
  breakpoints, but it turned out to be dead-end; memory isn't overwritten, pointer from pitch dat buffer is read
  beyond end of array, and turns out null (so need to check if fixup routine should fix up that area too or somehow
  it's getting the wrong coordinate (D2 is 57 and I think it shouldn't be over 55))
05.07.2018.
- debugged scrolling routines... I understand them much better now, this is very sloppily written, and the code is
  accessing indices outside the array bounds
06.07.2018.
- fixed in-game crashes, game wasn't clipping pattern drawing, and was reading patterns from nullptr
  and writing them to virtual screen area that was never shown
07.07.2018.
- fixed big S sprite not spinning, and crowd not cheering (now calling equivalent of TimerProc each frame)
- fixed generating weird construct "dword ptr [word ptr ..."
- fixed messed up sprites during the game, thank you OllyDbg! :) animation tables were overwritten by
  ResetResultSprites, since the sizes of ScorerInfo arrays were wrong (wrote wrong MASM expression :/)
- program now utilizes ~0% CPU when paused :)
08.07.2018.
- tried to solve damn goalkeeper position problem, unsuccessfully
09.07.2018.
- solved goalkeeper positions :) IDA was misinterpreting some data in positions array as offsets
- fixed CPU player always shooting too high when near goal
- seems edit tactics menu got fixed along the way :)
10.07.2018.
- setup.dat wasn't loaded if game was ran out of directory
- replaced "QUIT TO DOS" with "QUIT TO WINDOWS" :) & added facility to replace contents of data variables
  with given text in @replace section of symbols.txt
- added assert at startup to check if strings offsets are OK, so it will break if they get messed up again
- fixed darkened colors for result overlay appearing greenish
11.07.2018.

18.07.2018.
- fixed nasty crackle at sound init
- fixed too fast sound reproduction (played at invalid frequency)
- fixed slowed down replay of menu music when returning from game
- sound's kinda decent now, but there are still some problems (chants go quiet sometimes, some samples seem not to
  play or get muted sometimes)
19.07.2018.
- sound seems quite all right now, except small weird sound in one of the chants, like a quiet whistle
- got XMI support through ADLMIDI, but it sounds awful, will try compiling it with mingw later
20.07.2018.
- trying to fix choppy XMI music... unsuccessfully...
21.07.2018.
- faded MIDI menu music before the game
- finally found a way to play XMI MIDI properly, it was just a shitty example code :) we'll need advanced buffering
22.07.2018.
- implemented advanced buffering and XMI MIDI is finally playing great :)
- implemented MIDI music loop & fade
23.07.2018.
- fixed MIDI menu music messing up the Windows volume when fading out
- fixed OGG pop when starting music again after the game
24.07.2018.
- removed "short" from branch instructions if they want to jump to external symbol
- preparing for intro, at least got it to stop crashing via stubs :P
25.07.2018.
- added one-time play of title.* song if present as in SWOS CD version
- got the intro to play... psychedelic shapes :P
26.07.2018.
- sound on/off option from command line overrides setup.dat
- added sound to intro (at least it seems so :))
- at least intro now shows a picture that it should before it crashes (albeit quite darkened)
27.07.2018.
/
28.07.
- fixed some stuff in intro, but it's still crashing
- fixed title music playing at game frequency if intro was played
29.07.2018.
- intro is showing proper graphics now, but it's still not working correctly
- added command line options to skip intro and image reels
30.07.2018.

05-06.08.2018.
- banging my head about implementing multi-song ADL player, and keep it super efficient
07.08.2018.
- finally had some success with implementing title XMI song, although it's far from over
08.08.2018.
- XMI seems fine playing multiple songs now :)
- added command line parameter for switching midi bank
09.08.2018.
- fixed fade bug introduced with adding intro (it was so simple... d'oh!)
- ReadFile() is literate now, will write "1 byte" and not "1 bytes" :D
10.08.2018.
- fixed Windows volume for the game going to the max after selecting replay after a friendly match
- fixed title song repeating after going back to menu after a match
- fixed players disappearing on fade-out when aborting match in highlights
- fixed pressing 'R' during replay freezing the game
11.08.2018.
- fixed ida2asm to allow combining on-enter and save-regs actions on a single proc
- fixed invalid leading comment getting assigned to generated instructions from on-enter and save-regs
- trying to fix players disappearing during replay fade (when 'R' is pressed)
12.08.2018.
- finally all fades seem to be fixed, hope nothing else was broken in the process :)
- fixed menu song not playing after game is finished normally (not aborted)

- implemented loading and saving options via ini file
- fixed freeze before the game if there is no menu music
- fixed trying to load menu music indefinitely if there music files are missing
19.08.2018.
- added auto-detection of joypad adding/removal
- JoyKeyOrCtrlPressed detects mouse clicks too
20.08.2018.

  (also now collapsing consecutive uninitialized values (? - question marks))
- fixed memory overwrite (was actually allocating a bit less DOS memory than is required)
  ha! seems to have fixed career crash ;) (at least one)
26.08.2018.

- debugging goalkeepers... and they're... fixed?!?!
04.09.2018.
- painstaking analysis of diff files reveals the problem... bloody IDA syntax such as:
    mov ax, [esi+(TeamGeneralInfo+6Ch)]
  makes MASM generate some garbage code (no idea how that even worked without crashing)
  does it interpret it as a struct size? who knows...
- hopefully fixed all occurrences (there were like 5-6-7)
- anyway... fucking goalkeepers work!!! :)
- seems passing is also good now, but will be listening for news
- fixed crash when pausing in highlights
05.09.2018.
- [ida2asm] fixed unnecessary space in front of the label that has "short" removed
- [ida2asm] fixed a small glitch, it wasn't picking up \n at the end of the line in @replace section
06.09.2018.
/
07.09.2018.
- worked on fixing ida2asm invalid file limit determination
08.09.2018.
- worked on rewriting file chunk limit determination routine... until the morning but still failed to
  debug it properly
09.09.2018.
- finally, limit determination routine is much better now! I hope :)
- implemented no-break tags: anything between $no-break{ & $no-break} comments must not be split into different files
- optimized ida2asm a little bit ;) sorted if's in lookupToken() by frequency and tightened OutputWriter::outputTab()
- made sure that function leading comment remains in tact if file chunk limit falls in the middle of it
- trailing comment at the end of the file chunk gets outputted properly instead of disappearing
- moved simpleini.h to include root, all the single *.h files are now there
10.09.2018.
- [ida2asm] implemented check for closing no break tag without matching the opening one (across the files)
- started implementing interface to SWOS menu system
11.09.2018.

13.09.2018.
- worked a bit on menu parser
14.09.2018.
- almost finished initial syntax analysis of menu parser (then what's left are semantics, and output generation)
15.09.2018.
- first part of first part is done ;) will be focusing on finishing just enough of menu parser to get the current
  menu stuff to compile (right now that would be the options menu)

27.09.2018.
- introduced simple variables and expressions (so we can calculate coordinates)
28.09.2018.
- debugging expressions
29.09.2018.
- began implementing output
- integrated options menu in the project for the first time... and it actually works! :)
30.09.2018.
- templates tested and working
- implemented default entry dimensions (not even template entries could do that)
- entries in options menu are now of proper dimensions
- added assert if entry width or height is zero (makes the game crash)
- implemented entry label forward reference system (the thing that even YASM was lacking)
- implemented entry colors
- expanded built-in variables
01.10.2018.
- implemented callback function syntax
- passed entry symbolic names to C++
- implemented a secret in options menu ;)
- started implementing gameplay options menu
02.10.2018.
- menu variables holding defaults entry coordinates and dimensions are now calculated dynamically -- so now each
  entry gets its own values, enabling easy stacking of entries in regards to their predecessors
- built-in variables contained in user variables are now expanded correctly
- values of properties can now be full expressions
- added support for string tables
- implemented complete gameplay options UI
03.10.2018.
- [ida2asm] separated replace variables into their own namespace (there was a variable both in replace and import)
- implemented range check for variable values loaded from ini file
- added support for STDMENUTEXT (text pointers with value -1, and alias @kAlloc)
- added do not edit warning to the top of the .ini file
- added support for entries that are numbers
- implemented complete audio options UI
04.10.2018.

05.10.2018.
- fixed the game crashing if ran from outside the SWOS dir
- contemplated about how to implement video options, that menu should go to render module, now have to
  expand menu parser with includes to implement that nicely
06.10.2018.
- refactored parser to be a class without global variables (in order to implement include easier)
- implemented include directive (but haven't tested it :))
07.10.2018.
- debugged include directive and made it work
- working on implementing video options men, got some kind of outline
- implemented default text flags
08.10.2018.
- implemented function and variable that return text width/height in pixels
- I'm finally satisfied with the look of the video options menu (without resolution list)
09.10.2018.
- implemented display resolution gathering and filtering
10.10.2018.
- implemented #repeat <num.repeats> [, <loop variable] preprocessor directive
- implemented nested repeats
- implemented join directive (for concatenating tokens)
- implemented entry dot property syntax (for amending entry properties later on)
- set up non-dynamic entry order
11.10.2018.
- fixed text width calculation bug
- implemented export keyword to export variables to C++
- implemented resolution list scrolling
- implemented video options variables and their save/load to/from ini file
12.10.2018.
- created variables for video options and implemented loading/saving
- implemented whole video options except custom width/height input
- alt-enter switches to/from fake full screen mode (or real back to window)
13.10.2018.
- implemented custom window width/height input, as well as clamping it to the desktop size
- video options menu fully finished (I think ;))
14.10.2018.
/
15.10.2018.
- connected audio options variables, but it's all untested
16.10.2018.
- debugged audio options variables, made it _mostly_ work
- added "please wait" line while enumerating video modes
- fixed a bug in video options when an entry that becomes hidden was still selected when moving window to other
  monitor (when resolution list was recreated)
17.10.2018.
- added volume control for ADL as well
- implemented mouse selection in menus
- fixed ADL fade out (regression)
- increased the size of pitch patterns buffer (and placed it in a separate array of its own)
18.10.2018.
/
19.10.2018.
- fixed issue with git & swos.asm; git was doing CR/LF conversion and it made ida2asm crash (it was violating some
  assumptions about the file) -- starwindz was downloading the source 7z and it got Linux new lines by defaults
20.10.2018.
- worked on describing SWOS sound reproduction into sound.txt, discovered some new stuff
- fixed not playing intro crowd chants
21.10.2018.
- added crowd chants on/off to audio options menu
- discovered memory overwrite when loading result crowd chant (and it's only loaded when auto-replays are on?!)
  (however it might not be observed in original SWOS due to another bug)
- I think I understand sounds now very well (if not completely), I'll let it sleep over before deciding what
  to do next
22.10.2018.

23.10.2018.
- contemplating on new audio implementation
24.10.2018.
- started implementing new audio routines a bit
25.10.2018.
- worked on audio, but didn't make as much progress as I would want, ran into a bug in ida2asm file separation,
  same function ended up in two different files
26.10.2018.
- fixed a bug in ida2asm where it would put same function in two files if limit between files ended up somewhere in
  the function leading comments
27.10.2018.
- finished writing new comment loading code
- added new kind of variable to symbols.txt, functionPointer
28.10.2018.
- removed AIL + C lib + most of CD-ROM routines
- connected sound routines with stubs
- implemented comments & most of sfx, only crowd noise is missing atm
29.10.2018.
- added @insert-hook section to symbols.txt, name of the function comma line number goes there, and it will insert
  a <proc name>_<line number> call to external procedure; it's crapily done, only supports one call per proc but it
  was fairly quick to implement :P
- fixed bug when crowd chant wouldn't get reloaded with auto-replays off
- added more log lines for sound reproduction
- fixed a bug with incorrectly calculating random sample index
30.10.2018.
- fixed sample volumes
- implemented enqueued samples reproduction
- finally, it works nicely with original samples ;) now on to enable custom ones
31.10.2018.
- fixed custom comment loading
- connected header comments :)
- fixed menu song played twice when coming back from the game
- trying to implement delayed loading of samples (first we load data from files into memory, and later convert to
  Mix chunks, if ever needed)
01.11.2018.
- fixed delayed loading of samples, it all works great now
- fixed header comment also being played when CPU does it :)
- fixed same comments being picked twice in a row
02.11.2018.
- commentary categories are now neatly sorted to match the document ;)
- fixed some chants wrongly loaded from hard\*
- rearranged audio options menu
- injury comments are played now
- fixed intro chant not being played
- fixed F8 not turning comments on/off
- increased chants volume a bit
- fixed errors when playing with sound off
03.11.2018.
- fixed penalty comments not being played
- fixed original SWOS bugs with penalty flag staying on (discovered by Michael Mihelakakis)
