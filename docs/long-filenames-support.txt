DOS SWOS limitations in regard to files:
- files are limited to 8 characters for base name, 3 characters for extension
- maximum of 45 files will be displayed in the menu

These limitations are lifted in the following manner:
- scroll arrows will appear if there are more than 45 files, they can be used to scroll and reach all files;
  they scroll entire list up or down by one row when clicked (or mouse wheel moved)
  (that increases usability limit to perhaps couple hundred of files, but having that many files is a mess anyway,
  and it's recommended to clean them up occasionally)
- long filenames are supported, but they will be elided (fitted into available space with "..." at the end) if
  there is no room to display them in full; so there are more visible characters now but don't go overboard ;)

Normally files are shown in 3 columns, unless there are 8 or less files, in which case they will all be in one,
central column. If there is at least one long filename in the list and there are more than 8 files, 2 column layout
will be used, with wider entries.

Room for save filename input has been increased to 38 characters.

Scroll arrows should be reachable from right-most visible entries. Going up from top-right visible file entry should
land at top arrow, and going down from bottom-right should land at bottom arrow. Additionally, going right from
approximately top half of right-most visible file column should lead to up arrow, and bottom half should lead to down
arrow.

Using mouse wheel on this screen when there are more than 45 files should result in scrolling, independently of the
mouse cursor location.
