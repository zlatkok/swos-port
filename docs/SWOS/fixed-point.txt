Fixed point format
------------------
For more precise calculations SWOS uses 32-bit fixed point numbers, with 16 bits for integer part and 16 bits
for fractional part. Integer part has a sign bit (highest bit), while fraction has no sign, and is always
positive.

s|aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb

Value = a + 2^-16 * b
or
Value = a + b / 0x10000

Some examples (in hex notation):
 0.5  0000.8000
-0.5  ffff.8000
 3.25 0003.0400

When stored in memory, first word is fractional part, second word is integer part (offset +2) - most of the
time only integer part is used.

They can be added and subtracted as 32-bit numbers. Shifting left and right also works. After multiplying two
numbers result needs to be shifter right 16 bits.
