MoveCamera():
- if showFansCounter is non-zero bail
- initialize camera destination coordinates
    cameraDestX = ballSprite.deltaX
    cameraDestY = ballSprite.deltaY
    this is used in state #8 when the game is in progress for deciding next camera x/y direction
- check for main states:
    1) referee booking a player
    2) penalties shootout after the game
    3) leaving bench
    4) on bench or going to
    5) waiting on players to leave
    6) showing result on half-time
    7) showing result after the game
    8) standard follow-the-ball mode

1) referee booking a player (whichCard has non-zero value)
    - destination is the position of booked player
    - vertical limit is 37 (standard game paused limit)
    - velocity is 0
2) penalties after the game (playingPenalties is true)
    - destination: x = 336, y = 107
    - vertical limit is 0
    - velocity is 0
3) leaving bench (g_leavingSubsMenu is true)
    - destination: x = 211, y = 449
    - vertical limit is 37
    - velocity is 0
4) camera at bench or going to
    - destination: x = g_cameraLeavingSubsLimit, y = 449
    - vertical limit is variable here, if player is being substituted (coming or going) it moves to 51, while
      going to bench it's 37 (throw-in line), and when reaching bench area (y in [339..359]) it's 0 (all the way
      to the left edge)
    - velocity is 0

...

8)
    - maximum velocity is 40 pixels

- after destination coordinates, vertical limit and velocity have been set, velocity gets applied
- notice that velocity is added additionally to delta x/y, on top of standard deltas
- then the vertical limit is applied, it stretches on both sides of the pitch, depending on the state
    x gets clamped: limit <= x <= 352 - limit
- y limits:
    80 <= y <= 616
    16 <= y <= 664
    top:
        training game: >= 80
        normal game:   >= 16
    bottom:
        training game: <= 616
        normal game:   <= 664
- camera delta x and y are derived, by subtracting g_cameraX and g_cameraY from destination; only whole parts
  are used
- if there is no movement the function returns
- deltas are divided by 4 (with truncation), and multiplied with 0.25
- they are then clipped against maximum camera movement (= 5.0, or -5.0 if going up/left)
- after clipping, complete camera variables (whole+fractional) are added to the deltas, and they now become
  the current camera coordinates
- in the end absolute clipping limits are applied to camera coordinates:
    0 <= x <= 352
    16 <= y <= 680
- only the whole parts are clipped, and applied to global camera variables
- set cameraCoordinatesValid to zero
