earlier:
- struggled to create fastest possible parser, which eventually turned out to be a generated state machine
18.03.2018.
- finished custom step of Meson build
- refactored script a little
- working on enabling test of TookenLookup.cpp
19.03.2018.
- fixed invalid token lookup test generator dependency
- trying to get generated token lookup to compile with the tester
20.03.2018.
- managed to compile null tester
- had to change TokenLookup into header instead of cpp file so Meson would stop compiling it
- trying to create actual tester implementation

- added T_EOF handling
- working on tester implementation
01.04.2018.
/
02.04.2018.
- improved tester a bit
03.04.2018.
- implemented test string output (print string split into lines)
04.04.2018.
/
05.04.2018.
/
06.04.2018.
- properly implemented output of test string and test tokens
- got to a point where actual tester function needs to be written
07.04.2018.
- fixed a bug in test tokens output
- tester dummy compiled correctly!
- continuing with tester implementation, switched to raw multi-line strings where applicable
- tester basic function compiled for the first time!
08.04.2018.
- fixed tester crashing :)
- passed tests?!?! IMPOSSIBRU!!
- finished std lib lookup function, setting up performance test
09.04.2018.
- implemented custom hash function
- lookup generator + performance tests FINITO!!! RAWR!
- Meson is retarded, doesn't allow access to output from the tests >< (there's a not a very good workaround)
- found out about gperf & the other tool
- successfully added gperf to build, and verified that it is slower (albeit only slightly)
- other tool is a bit slower than gperf so skipping it (only advantage is it's 100% in C++)
- now creating Meson build for ida2asm, in order to have fully functional Visual Studio project
10.04.2018.
- had to modify Python script to accommodate retarded Meson's hard-coded expectancy about output file locations
- got up to the rest of the parser now, trying to get it compiled
11.04.2018.
- Meson build done, even though it's buggy for VS (doesn't rebuild when Python script changes)
- ida2asm successfully compiled!
- and it's not crashing anymore! :)
12,13.04.2018.
- working on parser, solid progress, hope to finish struct parsing soon
- enabled tokenizer to recognize and report numbers
14.04.2018.
- switched build to x86 (was x64), it can only be done when running Meson from x86 set up VS command prompt
- did some testing, and IFs turn out to be slightly faster than SWITCH (tables probably mess up the cache)
- switched to custom isspace that's 10x faster than the one from std lib (wtf)
- added support for parsing numbers, and debugged it
- in the light of recent changes gperf seems to slightly outperform the state machine
15.04.2018.
- after some changes state machine is beating gperf again :)
- improved custom hash by using binary search, now it's outperforming std::unordered_map in release too
- implemented state machine using ifs instead of switches, but it's just slightly slower
- fixed some bugs in parsing
16.04.2018.
- debugging parser and struct assembling code, getting more quirks resolved
17.04.2018.
- re-consolidated struct handling code
- fixed test (broken with new changes and optimizations)
18.04.2018.
- tested tokens with alignment, almost no difference, it even feels negligibly slower
- made lookupToken return hash for id's as well, performance hit is small
- implemented HashMap to store defines
19.04.2018.
- moved hash function to util and turned it into constexpr; however it came with a big performance hit due to
  recursion, so I made constexpr a second version to use for static strings
- made a template so I can just call constHash("some str") and everything is handled perfectly :)
- fixed includes, Meson already includes directories of generated files automatically
- code to catch custom hash collisions was buggy :) but I don't wanna bother finding collision-free function
- moved parseInt() to Token, it was much more natural fit
- now parsing dot directives
- started work on labels

- planned on adding instructions and 'output lines' in general
03.05.2018.
- worked on expanding parser with [,],comma,+,-,* (will need it for parsing instructions)
04.05.2018.
- finally passed tests with parser extensions
- trying to create some sort of instruction parsing/storing skeleton
05.05.2018.
- worked on instruction storage implementation
06.05.2018.
- working on instruction parsing & related stuff
- added register size field
07.05.2018.
- continuing work on instructions, came up with an idea to use placement new
08.05.2018.
- refactored instructions, used placement new (sooo much better now!), continuing work on parsing
09.05.2018.
/
10.05.2018.
/
11.05.2018.
- attempt to change Token into full fledged class failed miserably
12.05.2018.
- added single-quoted string to tokenizer
13.05.2018.
- a bit of work on data item parsing
14.05.2018.
/
15.05.2018.
- close to finishing data item parsing (for now)
16.05.2018.
- worked on adding dup() support to tokenizer (sheesh)
17.05.2018.
- changed the way number parsing works
- refactored lot of code, it's shorter and more clear now
- finally passed all test with parser dup() extension
- after all the changes it's 25% faster!!! (and I wasn't optimizing at all) :)
- initial collecting of data items seems to work fine
18.05.2018.
- added some cool templates to OutputItem ;)
- eliminated size inside output items themselves, only keeping it at outer output item container
- it occurred to me to run static analysis, it uncovered couple of interesting things
- parsed function local variables and arguments
19.05.2018.
- instructions can have THREE operands... gah, fixing that
- save the comments from ignored entities
- parsing passed for the first time!!
- changed struct parsing code to use placement new as well (ended up with more compact and clear code)
- turned size_t to explicit size type where mattered
- starting work on output machinesZ, for now verbatim (copy input as is) to verify parsing
20.05.2018.
- added measurement of the time whole program took to execute
- made output hierarchy, went into details, file opening, reading into buffer etc.
- added #pragma pack where needed, we were using sizeof() which was returning the size with padding
  (and I later assumed no padding when copying data)
21.05.2018.
- fixed a bug in calculating struct size, a bit of progress in verbatim output
22.05.2018.
- struct output is done & correct!! :)
23.05.2018.
- added support for precompiled headers
- defines outputted correctly!! :)
- filtered original swos.asm in the same way as ida2asm, I can diff like a boss now ;)
24.05.2018.
- set up skeleton for instructions output and outputted some basic elements
- replaced all that ugly duplicated code for size assertion with a cool template
- restructured instruction handling code but now it's crashing... ugh... too late to continue
25.05.2018.
- improved instruction processing a bit, but it's still not working properly
26.05.2018.
- improved instruction processing, it's almost there :) just a few more glitches, I hope :)
27.05.2018.
- turned + into strictly binary operator (numbers can't start with it), since IDA uses it ambiguously (& fixed tests)
- missed that variable after "offset" part can also have its offset ;)
- implemented stack variables output
- implemented data items output
- discovered junk chars in strings... sigh... handled those and added tests as well
- they have a char constant: '\'... >_<
- verbatim output is now close enough! :)
28.05.2018.
- tried assembling with TASM but _no chance_
- set up output class hierarchy to share output code efficiently
- haha MASM swallowed up structs :)
- as well as defines! took some friendly persuasion (ie. editing names in IDA), MASM is picky about keywords
29.05.2018.
- implemented mechanism for removing unneeded procs via a text file (this will be expanded later)
- fixed instruction parameter spacing in output
- fixed a bug when some new lines ended up being non-Windows (\r got eaten)
- gah... found out that stupid MASM needs a command line argument to be case-insensitive
- worked around MASM bug (or *extremely* undocumented area), whereas it seems impossible to initialize an array of
  structures containing array of other structures
30.05.2018.
- MASM regards any label inside proc as local, while IDA doesn't and calls them liberally, so worked around that by
  turning each non-anonymous label inside proc into an empty proc (nested proc's are OK)
- included "assume" into output (since MASM needs it)
- started working on parallelized parser (which should break input file to many separate files too)
31.05.2018.
- worked on breaking parsing into threads... unsuccessfully
01.06.2018.
- implemented parsing units
- implemented error reporting system for parsing units
02.06.2018.
- fixed comments being left out when determining chunk borders (as well as segments)
- set up output system for parsing units
03.06.2018.
- fixed invalid output file forming if only a path without filename is given
- now workers only output disassembly and structs & defines go separately
- wrote a Perl script for creating a cleaned up version of swos.asm for testing if everything's in order
- fixed errors in determining limits of input file chunks
- fixed error in parsing directives with comments
- fixed empty lines at starts of output files
- fixed invalid line numbers when reporting parsing errors
04.06.2018.
- set up string set class to hold references
- decided to go with generic map
- learned that externs require type for MASM, need to redesign solution
05.06.2018.
- implemented generic StringMap template, and wired it to defines (seems to work! :))
- redesigned a bit StringMap and StringSet, added range for loop support, it's cleaner now with less code repetitions
- they can also change size and reallocate now (although we don't want them to do that)
- did some refactoring on asm converter worker, it's much nicer now
- finished reference resolving, but it's untested :)
06.06.2018.
- resolved all externs and publics, sent it to output... but it's not working :)
07.06.2018.
- debugging externs resolving
08.06.2018.
- more debugging of externs resolving
- did a bit of refactoring, const Token is used in sooo many places, so aliased it with CToken
09.06.2018.
- did some research on SWOS palettes (unrelated to this project ;))
- finally output is done without triggering any assertions :P
- got the script for assembling all output files going, fixing all the errors
- everything assembled without an error???
- researched on raylib vs SDL, will go with SDL after all
10.06.2018.
- reverted StringMap<T>::Node to private, now iterator returns special struct type with all the necessary data
- removed duplicate references, seems like it slightly improved performance
- implemented move constructor for StringView
- it's not assembling anything... object files are 230 bytes long...
- I was happy too soon :) include had "end" in it so the assembly stopped before any real output
11.06.2018.
- move segments to labels before resolving references to help cache
- finally fixed bugs in extern matching, now line numbers in MASM errors work again! :)
- however, we're back to fixing assembling errors due to MASM idiosyncrasies
12.06.2018.
- fixed redefined Amiga registers
- fixed broken reference duplicate removal
- switched to MASM 8.0; some errors disappeared :D
- fixed invalid prefix error
13.06.2018.
- removed char * and void * operators from String class, it's safer and more efficient now
- added workaround for weird IDA behaviour of not marking initialized structs with data as struct variables
- added guaranteed EOF token to the end of each unit
- added support for deleting range of functions from the assembly
- so far pieces 2, 3, 4, 7 & 8 are assembling fully!
14.06.2018.
- fixed quoted string parsing, I assumed it would work same as in C, but I was completely wrong
- piece 6 and 1 assembling correctly!
- turns out "assume" directives were causing MASM to freak out and add cs: prefix to almost every instruction :P
  (this made some short jumps fall out of range and cause errors)
- it all REALLY assembled correctly this time!!!
- it's linking _without a single_ warning, whew!
15.06.2018.
- plotted out plan for building the whole thing
- went and manually built SDL2 and belonging libraries
16.06.2018.
- will compile libs manually and just use the resulting lib files (with debug versions as well)
- fixed couple of bugs in ida2asm
- fighting with Meson again
17.06.2018.
- build systems are shit, gonna write my own script
18.06.2018.
/
19.06.2018.
/
20.06.2018.
- gave up on writing script, making Visual Studio project and that's it
- great day, it's all linked together and actually correctly invoking SWOS code!!! :)))
21.06.2018.
- added capability to replace asm functions with imports from C++ to ida2asm
- making ida2asm generate swos.h, better to keep it all in one place
22.06.2018.
- finished symbol file parsing code
- added possibility to remove variables from assembly too (not just procs)
- removed a bunch of useless crap and rerouted SWOS() into C++ :)
23.06.2018.
- fixed export needed by C++ not turning up in publics list if it wasn't needed as public in asm
- implemented a nice templatized class to deal with nasty conversions involved with 68k registers ;)
- advancing toward initial image scrolling
24.06.2018.
- collapsed consecutive anonymous data items to 'x dup(y)' form (shaved of ~300kb and should speed up assembling)
- fixed some invalid code, refactored source a little, made it a bit nicer
  (learned that fread() has max read count that it accepts, 1mb = OK, 10mb = FAIL)
- worked on initial image scrolling, will need palette settings & flipping for this
- SDL is so under-documented, will need to figure out a reliable way to do 70FPS precise enough, as well as
  fast way to scale up to at least 640x480
25.06.2018.
- reading docs, trying to figure out how to get 320x200x8 buffer to the screen (efficiently)
26.06.2018.
- managed to draw intro scrolling images, but palette for two.256 comes out wrong :(
27.06.2018.
- ida2asm now reports if any symbol from symbols.txt wasn't found in the asm file
- allowed data items to spawn ranges too
- drew a menu :) but still can't move cursor
28.06.2018.
- added code for keyboard handling (but it's not working)
- enabled ShowMenu
- had crashes in menu drawing functions, turned out to be caused by some SWOS functions destroying registers
  VC++ expects not to change across function calls; modified ida2asm, added generation of push/pop instructions
  to save and restore those registers and that set it straight
- seems like MASM uses nops (0x90) for alignment instead of zeros in data segment, had a string lose ending zero
  terminator because of it, will need to be more careful since retarded MASM can't be instructed which value to use
- implemented natvis file (debugger instructions) for my custom classes, it works great now
29.06.2018.
- added support for hooking functions (inject call to our function on entry)
- placed replaced symbols into SWOS namespace
- some small refactoring
- discovered that the crash outside IDE was due to joypad controls which weren't patched
- implemented directory listing
- implemented log file
- added macro for invoking SWOS procs with relevant registers preserved (esi is especially problem, since it's used
  in so many places), release version used some registers that got clobbered and crashed
- integrated crash reporter
- finished Bash script for creating backups
30.06.2018.
- fixed palette problem, I'm the retard :D only copied 256 bytes instead of 768
- fixed bug in ida2asm where a data belonging to a menu that landed between the chunks got lost (will detect and
  report it if it ever happens again)
- fixed initial cross fade from images to menu
- added 68k register values to crash report
- implemented text input and made hooks bit more elegant and general
- figured out why it's crashing on Playa's machine: MASM is treating variables as pointers within procs in data
  segment... on my machine it works randomly but overwrites memory all over the place
  fixed it by temporarily switching to cseg if proc isn't inside it
01.07.2018.
- fixed highlights not loading in release mode (LoadFile needs to set zero flag even though it's the only outcome)
- removed int 3 at start from DIYLeagueTournamentMatch (bah)
- fixed a bug in ida2asm's collapsing of contiguous anonymous data items... was only comparing their value but
  not the size... yikes!
- fixed not being able to close program while fading (process events on each palette change)
- added synchronization, not perfect but seems OK for now
- fixed lost leading comments on data items
- fixed errors in stdlib fopen(), seems it didn't like unaligned stack, SWOS was pushing a word, made it push
  dword always
- fixed crash before the game, LoadFile() wasn't returning size in D1 per specification, so a low number was inside,
  causing sprite fixup to be done only partially
02.07.2018.
- fixed a bug in log functions (it was choosing va_list variant over ... for 1 argument, had to rename to logv)
- did some timing experiments (unsuccessfully, it's still too slow/fast, but I'll check swpe it had good sync)
03.07.2018.
- fixed fade out to black from stadium menu when starting the game
04.07.2018.
- debugged in-game crash, I thought pitch memory is maybe getting overwritten, tested it with OllyDbg memory range
  breakpoints, but it turned out to be dead-end; memory isn't overwritten, pointer from pitch dat buffer is read
  beyond end of array, and turns out null (so need to check if fixup routine should fix up that area too or somehow
  it's getting the wrong coordinate (D2 is 57 and I think it shouldn't be over 55))
05.07.2018.
- debugged scrolling routines... I understand them much better now, this is very sloppily written, and the code is
  accessing indices outside the array bounds
06.07.2018.
- fixed in-game crashes, game wasn't clipping pattern drawing, and was reading patterns from nullptr
  and writing them to virtual screen area that was never shown
07.07.2018.
- fixed big S sprite not spinning, and crowd not cheering (now calling equivalent of TimerProc each frame)
- fixed generating weird construct "dword ptr [word ptr ..."
- fixed messed up sprites during the game, thank you OllyDbg! :) animation tables were overwritten by
  ResetResultSprites, since the sizes of ScorerInfo arrays were wrong (wrote wrong MASM expression :/)
- program now utilizes ~0% CPU when paused :)
08.07.2018.
- tried to solve damn goalkeeper position problem, unsuccessfully
09.07.2018.
- solved goalkeeper positions :) IDA was misinterpreting some data in positions array as offsets
- fixed CPU player always shooting too high when near goal
- seems edit tactics menu got fixed along the way :)
10.07.2018.
- setup.dat wasn't loaded if game was ran out of directory
- replaced "QUIT TO DOS" with "QUIT TO WINDOWS" :) & added facility to replace contents of data variables
  with given text in @replace section of symbols.txt
- added assert at startup to check if strings offsets are OK, so it will break if they get messed up again
- fixed darkened colors for result overlay appearing greenish
11.07.2018.

18.07.2018.
- fixed nasty crackle at sound init
- fixed too fast sound reproduction (played at invalid frequency)
- fixed slowed down replay of menu music when returning from game
- sound's kinda decent now, but there are still some problems (chants go quiet sometimes, some samples seem not to
  play or get muted sometimes)
19.07.2018.
- sound seems quite all right now, except small weird sound in one of the chants, like a quiet whistle
- got XMI support through ADLMIDI, but it sounds awful, will try compiling it with mingw later
20.07.2018.
- trying to fix choppy XMI music... unsuccessfully...
21.07.2018.
- faded MIDI menu music before the game
- finally found a way to play XMI MIDI properly, it was just a shitty example code :) we'll need advanced buffering
22.07.2018.
- implemented advanced buffering and XMI MIDI is finally playing great :)
- implemented MIDI music loop & fade
23.07.2018.
- fixed MIDI menu music messing up the Windows volume when fading out
- fixed OGG pop when starting music again after the game
24.07.2018.
- removed "short" from branch instructions if they want to jump to external symbol
- preparing for intro, at least got it to stop crashing via stubs :P
25.07.2018.
- added one-time play of title.* song if present as in SWOS CD version
- got the intro to play... psychedelic shapes :P
26.07.2018.
- sound on/off option from command line overrides setup.dat
- added sound to intro (at least it seems so :))
- at least intro now shows a picture that it should before it crashes (albeit quite darkened)
27.07.2018.
/
28.07.
- fixed some stuff in intro, but it's still crashing
- fixed title music playing at game frequency if intro was played
29.07.2018.
- intro is showing proper graphics now, but it's still not working correctly
- added command line options to skip intro and image reels

- banging my head about implementing multi-song ADL player, and keep it super efficient
07.08.2018.
- finally had some success with implementing title XMI song, although it's far from over
08.08.2018.
- XMI seems fine playing multiple songs now :)
- added command line parameter for switching midi bank
09.08.2018.
- fixed fade bug introduced with adding intro (it was so simple... d'oh!)
- ReadFile() is literate now, will write "1 byte" and not "1 bytes" :D
10.08.2018.
- fixed Windows volume for the game going to the max after selecting replay after a friendly match
- fixed title song repeating after going back to menu after a match
- fixed players disappearing on fade-out when aborting match in highlights
- fixed pressing 'R' during replay freezing the game
11.08.2018.
- fixed ida2asm to allow combining on-enter and save-regs actions on a single proc
- fixed invalid leading comment getting assigned to generated instructions from on-enter and save-regs
- trying to fix players disappearing during replay fade (when 'R' is pressed)
12.08.2018.
- finally all fades seem to be fixed, hope nothing else was broken in the process :)
- fixed menu song not playing after game is finished normally (not aborted)

- implemented loading and saving options via ini file
- fixed freeze before the game if there is no menu music
- fixed trying to load menu music indefinitely if there music files are missing
19.08.2018.
- added auto-detection of joypad adding/removal
- JoyKeyOrCtrlPressed detects mouse clicks too
20.08.2018.

  (also now collapsing consecutive uninitialized values (? - question marks))
- fixed memory overwrite (was actually allocating a bit less DOS memory than is required)
  ha! seems to have fixed career crash ;) (at least one)

- debugging goalkeepers... and they're... fixed?!?!
04.09.2018.
- painstaking analysis of diff files reveals the problem... bloody IDA syntax such as:
    mov ax, [esi+(TeamGeneralInfo+6Ch)]
  makes MASM generate some garbage code (no idea how that even worked without crashing)
  does it interpret it as a struct size? who knows...
- hopefully fixed all occurrences (there were like 5-6-7)
- anyway... fucking goalkeepers work!!! :)
- seems passing is also good now, but will be listening for news
- fixed crash when pausing in highlights
05.09.2018.
- [ida2asm] fixed unnecessary space in front of the label that has "short" removed
- [ida2asm] fixed a small glitch, it wasn't picking up \n at the end of the line in @replace section
06.09.2018.

07.09.2018.
- worked on fixing ida2asm invalid file limit determination
08.09.2018.
- worked on rewriting file chunk limit determination routine... until the morning but still failed to
  debug it properly
09.09.2018.
- finally, limit determination routine is much better now! I hope :)
- implemented no-break tags: anything between $no-break{ & $no-break} comments must not be split into different files
- optimized ida2asm a little bit ;) sorted if's in lookupToken() by frequency and tightened OutputWriter::outputTab()
- made sure that function leading comment remains in tact if file chunk limit falls in the middle of it
- trailing comment at the end of the file chunk gets outputted properly instead of disappearing
- moved simpleini.h to include root, all the single *.h files are now there
10.09.2018.
- [ida2asm] implemented check for closing no break tag without matching the opening one (across the files)
- started implementing interface to SWOS menu system
11.09.2018.

13.09.2018.
- worked a bit on menu parser
14.09.2018.
- almost finished initial syntax analysis of menu parser (then what's left are semantics, and output generation)
15.09.2018.
- first part of first part is done ;) will be focusing on finishing just enough of menu parser to get the current
  menu stuff to compile (right now that would be the options menu)

28.09.2018.
- debugging expressions
29.09.2018.
- began implementing output
- integrated options menu in the project for the first time... and it actually works! :)
30.09.2018.
- templates tested and working
- implemented default entry dimensions (not even template entries could do that)
- entries in options menu are now of proper dimensions
- added assert if entry width or height is zero (makes the game crash)
- implemented entry label forward reference system (the thing that even YASM was lacking)
- implemented entry colors
- expanded built-in variables
01.10.2018.
- implemented callback function syntax
- passed entry symbolic names to C++
- implemented a secret in options menu ;)
- started implementing gameplay options menu
02.10.2018.
- menu variables holding defaults entry coordinates and dimensions are now calculated dynamically -- so now each
  entry gets its own values, enabling easy stacking of entries in regards to their predecessors
- built-in variables contained in user variables are now expanded correctly
- values of properties can now be full expressions
- added support for string tables
- implemented complete gameplay options UI
03.10.2018.

- implemented range check for variable values loaded from ini file
- added support for STDMENUTEXT (text pointers with value -1, and alias @kAlloc)
- added do not edit warning to the top of the .ini file
- added support for entries that are numbers
- implemented complete audio options UI
04.10.2018.
/
05.10.2018.
- fixed the game crashing if ran from outside the SWOS dir
- contemplated about how to implement video options, that menu should go to render module, now have to
  expand menu parser with includes to implement that nicely
06.10.2018.
- refactored parser to be a class without global variables (in order to implement include easier)
- implemented include directive (but haven't tested it :))
07.10.2018.
- debugged include directive and made it work
- working on implementing video options men, got some kind of outline
- implemented default text flags
08.10.2018.
- implemented function and variable that return text width/height in pixels
- I'm finally satisfied with the look of the video options menu (without resolution list)
09.10.2018.
- implemented display resolution gathering and filtering
10.10.2018.
- implemented #repeat <num.repeats> [, <loop variable] preprocessor directive
- implemented nested repeats
- implemented join directive (for concatenating tokens)
- implemented entry dot property syntax (for amending entry properties later on)
- set up non-dynamic entry order
11.10.2018.
- fixed text width calculation bug
- implemented export keyword to export variables to C++
- implemented resolution list scrolling
- implemented video options variables and their save/load to/from ini file
12.10.2018.
- created variables for video options and implemented loading/saving
- implemented whole video options except custom width/height input
- alt-enter switches to/from fake full screen mode (or real back to window)
13.10.2018.
- implemented custom window width/height input, as well as clamping it to the desktop size
- video options menu fully finished (I think ;))
14.10.2018.
/
15.10.2018.
- connected audio options variables, but it's all untested
16.10.2018.
- debugged audio options variables, made it _mostly_ working
- added "please wait" line while enumerating video modes
- fixed a bug in video options when an entry that becomes hidden was still selected when moving window to other
  monitor (when resolution list was recreated)
17.10.2018.
- added volume control for ADL as well
- implemented mouse selection in menus
- fixed ADL fade out (regression)
- increased the size of pitch patterns buffer (and placed it in a separate array of its own)
18.10.2018.
/
19.10.2018.
- fixed issue with git & swos.asm; git was doing CR/LF conversion and it made ida2asm crash (it was violating some
  assumptions about the file) -- starwindz was downloading the source 7z and it got Linux new lines by defaults
20.10.2018.
- worked on describing SWOS sound reproduction into sound.txt, discovered some new stuff
- fixed not playing intro crowd chants
21.10.2018.
- added crowd chants on/off to audio options menu
- discovered memory overwrite when loading result crowd chant (and it's only loaded when auto-replays are on?!)
  (however it might not be observed in original SWOS due to another bug)
- I think I understand sounds now very well (if not completely), I'll let it sleep over before deciding what
  to do next
22.10.2018.
/
23.10.2018.
- contemplating on new audio implementation
24.10.2018.
- started implementing new audio routines a bit
25.10.2018.
- worked on audio, but didn't make as much progress as I would want, ran into a bug in ida2asm file separation,
  same function ended up in two different files
26.10.2018.
- fixed a bug in ida2asm where it would put same function in two files if limit between files ended up somewhere in
  the function leading comments
27.10.2018.
- finished writing new comment loading code
- added new kind of variable to symbols.txt, functionPointer
28.10.2018.
- removed AIL + C lib + most of CD-ROM routines
- connected sound routines with stubs
- implemented comments & most of sfx, only crowd noise is missing atm
29.10.2018.
- added @insert-hook section to symbols.txt, name of the function comma line number goes there, and it will insert
  a <proc name>_<line number> call to external procedure; it's crapily done, only supports one call per proc but it
  was fairly quick to implement :P
- fixed bug when crowd chant wouldn't get reloaded with auto-replays off
- added more log lines for sound reproduction
- fixed a bug with incorrectly calculating random sample index
30.10.2018.
- fixed sample volumes
- implemented enqueued samples reproduction
- finally, it works nicely with original samples ;) now on to enable custom ones
31.10.2018.
- fixed custom comment loading
- connected header comments :)
- fixed menu song played twice when coming back from the game
- trying to implement delayed loading of samples (first we load data from files into memory, and later convert to
  Mix chunks, if ever needed)
01.11.2018.
- fixed delayed loading of samples, it all works great now
- fixed header comment also being played when CPU does it :)
- fixed same comments being picked twice in a row
02.11.2018.
- commentary categories are now neatly sorted to match the document ;)
- fixed some chants wrongly loaded from hard\*
- rearranged audio options menu
- injury comments are played now
- fixed intro chant not being played
- fixed F8 not turning comments on/off
- increased chants volume a bit
- fixed errors when playing with sound off
03.11.2018.
- fixed penalty comments not being played
- fixed original SWOS bugs with penalty flag staying on (discovered by Michael Mihelakakis)
- removed even more CD-ROM routines (sadly, some small number still remains)
- rewriting MenuProc in C++

09.11.2018.
- rewrote MenuProc in C++ (hopefully correctly! :))
10.11.2018.
- moved swossym.h out of source dir into output dir, since it's a generated file
- removed crazy, probably invalid high bit clearing of pitch pattern pointers
- fixed ida2asm file splitting when it has align directive preceding a proc that's on the limit
11.11.2018.
- added prevention of mouse selecting whatever item it is on initially when the program starts
- solved starwindz's problem with pitch (I hope!) :)
12.11.2018.
- fade-out title song at start
- hide the cursor while in borderless window full-screen mode
- crowd background noise (that loops the whole game) is now turned on/off together with chants
- temporarily disabled chairman scenes

13.11.2018.
/
14.11.2018.
- allowed symbol that's removed + imported in ida2asm
- set sensible default values for missing variables in ini file (instead of zeros)
15.11.2018.
- wrote mouse input routine :)
16.11.2018.

18.11.2018.
- learned that sprintf_s _does not_ behave as I expected :/ what I really needed was snprintf
- [mnu2h] implemented #print directive for easier debugging
- [mnu2h] fixed bug when reading x/y menu coordinates (missing "self." :)), and implemented output
- [mnu2h] removed previousProperty mechanism, and I had a feeling I was implementing it for nothing :)
- [mnu2h] added dot directive in order to be able to declare entry properties in terms of other entry properties
- made menus always controllable with keyboard, even when no player has keyboard selected
- implemented joypad data saving to options, at least the bulk of it
19.11.2018.
- implemented joypad data loading, fixed some errors
- fixed mouse ruining other controls (I hope!)
20.11.2018.
- implemented redefine keys "dialog", although it's quite buggy
21.11.2018.
- debugged redefine keys, it works pretty good now
- started implementing on select routines for the actual changing of controls
22.11.2018.
- finished on select routines, fixed some bugs, started (made stub) select joypad menu
23.11.2018.
- [mnu2h] added warning about unused variables (only non-included though)
24.11.2018.
- fixed swapped comment playing functions (foul and dangerous play)
25.11.2018.
- [mnu2h] fixed some bugs and added line number to referencing unknown entry error

16.12.2018.
/
17.12.2018.
- repositioned config entries and implemented highlighting and enabling/disabling on main controls menu
18.12.2018.
- [mnu2h] fixed handling of next entries if disabled and next direction are given
- [mnu2h] fixed #join directive (was returning one token before the proper one)
- fixed controls menu items order
19.12.2018.
- further fixed controls menu items order (hopefully it's all good now)
- implemented scroll arrow handlers (and corrected arrow positions)
20.12.2018.
- worked on implementing controls selection from the menu (although it needs debugging)
21.12.2018.
- fixed controls selection (seems quite all right now)
- fixed item transition order (control items to scroll arrows)
- fixed infinite loop in InputText (was happening since MenuProc rewrite in C++)
22.12.2018.
- found out that I've missed to analyze CheckControls, but luckily it can stay as is (it just translates
  both player controls into menu controls (ORs them))
- trying to fix controls getting stuck in menus even after key release when player 2 is set to mouse,
  and finally succeeded! forgot to reset the controls as the first step (d-oh!), how did it work at all??
23.12.2018.
- a little bit of analysing, but no results
24.12.2018.
- fixed invalid entry selection by mouse calculations (y coordinate wasn't taking into account black bars
  on top and bottom if height isn't a multiple of 200)
- set default height to be multiple of 200
- started implementing play match menu fire, but it will be more complicated then I anticipated;
  hopefully any joypad fire press should select that joypad for the team (as well as mouse click)
25.12.2018.
- thought out how to apply controls through fire in play match menu and maintain them throughout the game
- the need to track all joypad buttons will require that all joypads be open, which means big changes to
  joypad processing code...
26.12.2018.
/
27.12.2018.
- I've decided to go with always current list of all connected joypads, player's choice will be an index there, and
  we will be able to track all the buttons pressed anytime (I've read some SDL code and it doesn't seem that tracking
  all joypads will pose a significant resource drain)
28.12.2018.
- first phase of moving to permanent joypad list is finished, gotta fix menus to use it too
- GUIDs of selected joypads are now saved, and an attempt is made to restore it at the next startup
- list of joystick ID's in recently added order is maintained (single id won't cut it)
29.12.2018.
- fully switched to a new way of handling joypad input
- just noticed that each SWOS menu has something "useful" selected upon entry... NOT exit button which I was
  systematically setting as default in all of my menus... d-oh!
- fixed controls menu items order some more :)
- added log entries for control selection
- wow, it didn't even crash :P
30.12.2018.
- separated kKeyboard controls into explicit kKeyboard1 and kKeyboard2 in order to be able to use them independently
  during the game
- implemented key conflict resolution at startup if both players are using keyboard
- plenty of refactoring
- fixed some small bugs
- reorganized scan codes into a small class, stopped using SWOS variables
31.12.2018.
- fixed mouse clicks when only player 2 keyboard is selected (they would stop working)
- fixed player 1 having invalid index for selected joypad
- fixed invalid joypad assignment if GUIDs are not found
- fixed fire staying on shortly after clicking a menu item
- implemented mouse wheel scrolling where applicable ;)
01.01.2019.
- fixed wrong joypad GUIDs ending up in ini file
- fixed warning message overlapping mouse click aborts label in redefine keys dialog
- changed menu default items from exit to something useful (usually top element), except in controls menu (for safety)
- refactored video and audio options saving/loading into renderer/audio module (where they belong)
- no more "Window mode change requested, from 1 to 1" message in the log :)
- played a first mouse "controlled" game :)
02.01.2019.
- implemented selection of joypad by simply pressing fire, had to add special case handling of my stupid game port to
  USB adapter which sends button codes when axis are used for the first time
03.01.2019.
- [mnu2h] fixed parsing empty file :)
- [mnu2h] added a rudimentary check for variables that go into C++, making sure they aren't C++ keywords (not
  everything is checked, that might be a too big effort, but even checking at this level helps)
- in-game controls are finally working properly! as well as any controller fire on "PLAY MATCH" entry
- working on rewriting replay/exit menu after friendly game, but so far got only black screen
04.01.2019.
- fixed mouse not working on replay/exit menu, it's working perfectly now, just needed to redraw the menu
  before the fade-in ;-)
- added a new shortcut: alt-shift-enter -> going into true full screen mode
- fixed bench button not working on keyboard controls
- fixed joypad auto-connect (player 1 and 2 were swapped... d-oh!)
- mouse cursor doesn't get hidden anymore when going full screen if we have a mouse player
- playing with mouse is a bit easier now, but it's still awful :D
05.01.2019.
- got some cool ideas for joystick config menu ;) (decided to combine everything into one menu)
- things can't go on like this, I simply must refactor and divide monstrous controls.cpp file
- pooh... refactored the damn thing, I'm dying
06.01.2019.
- working on joypad config menu, it turns out there will be quite a lot to do there
- finished joypad info & readings display
07.01.2019.
- introduced error checking when saving and loading options
- just realized I haven't checked for invalid joypad buttons input (fixed!)
- working on joypad config menu, finished numeric input in menus, rewrote input routine from scratch, it works
  so beautifully :)
08.01.2019.
- [mnu2h] fixed invalid line number when warning about unused variables (was storing wrong token)
- [mnu2h] fixed invalid unmatched parenthesis error if there's more than one closing parenthesis clumped together
- [mnu2h] fixed last token in the file getting ignored
- [mnu2h] fixed incredible error of ending up with wrong results due to expressions not having outer parenthesis, so
  if we got a = b + c, d = 2 * a, it expands to d = 2 * b + c (ouch!)
- also learned the difference between parenthesis and parentheses :D
- incredibly dull work of setting up dead zone box menu entries
09.01.2019.
- [mnu2h] added some aliases to some entry properties cause I kept getting it wrong :)
- set up dead zone % +/- buttons order
- introducing button handlers to actually change dead zone values
10.01.2019.
- finished implementing handlers for changing all dead zone values (both absolute and percentage)
- dead box "animation" finished and works nice :)
11.01.2019.
- finished joypad button selection! finally the joypad config menu is finished! :)
- fixed few critical bugs preventing match from playing
- fixed mouse wheel stopping working after returning to a menu with wheel entries
- added right mouse click = exit menu (works on most menus but not every single one)
12.01.2019.
- finally fixed mouse coordinate calculation in odd sized window (for good I hope!) ;)
- refactored render into video dir with several components (menu is now in its own file)
- stopped hiding mouse pointer in fake fullscreen mode if we're not in the game, and fixed entry selection
- applied my beautiful number input routine to width/height fields in video options menu, and centered entries
  a bit better
13.01.2019.
- changed crash report to grab swos.ini instead of setup.dat (woops)
- fixed crash at startup if joypads aren't selected for both players
- forgot to save regs of GetTextSize, seems it caused crash at Playa's
- fixed Int2Ascii not returning A1 as the end of the string (totally missed that one)
- [mnu2h] fixed undefined fields in entry when there previous entry variables are used in first entry
- [mnu2h] added proper support for changing meny x/y coordinates
14.01.2019.

- [ida2asm] added special symbol "@end" which can be used in symbol removal range as an end of range marker, meaning
  remove everything until the end of the file
- worked a little on main menu reimplementation
22.01.2019.
- wrote a bit of Awk[ward] script to convert nationality codes to enum :)
- finished converting main menu, just noticed that colors looks slightly different compared to DOSBox
- [ida2asm] fixed not reporting duplicate symbols in symbols.txt
- [mnu2h] if function name is prefixed with tilde AND in quotes, it will be sent to C++ as is (and without checking)
- added handling of numeric keyboard digits
- fixed invalid mouse behaviour in full screen (I hope! too tired to check...)
23.01.2019.
- and of course it's not fixed, it's not THAT easy
- improved error handling in full screen switching logic
24.01.2019.
- but NOW I really fixed mouse in full screen, seems I had to clear full screen flag of the window and then set it
  back in order for changes to occur and mouse coordinates to be correctly translated
- request to switch to the same full screen resolution we're in will be refused
25.01.2019.
/
26.01.2019.
- rewrote delay routine and switched to high precision timer... wow, the game feels much better! downside is that
  more CPU is used, but we'll see if something can be done there
27.01.2019.
- PrepareMenu() was calling ConvertMenu() without saving the registers... yikes, no idea how it even worked so far

- did some planning on how to implement replays; will need to reimplement selectFilesMenu, that will be a bitch
- reversed select files menu, another tiny corner of SWOS is charted, woopteedoo
- [ida2asm] fixed reporting `@end' as a duplicate symbol
- [ida2asm] segments are now properly terminated if they are split in different files
17.02.2019.
- fixed invalid constants for gray frame... all options menu header items had invalid colored frame (dark gray
  instead of light gray), funny how nobody noticed :P
- [mnu2h] fixed outputting initial menu x/y coordinates (last ones listed in file were outputted as initial)
- [mnu2h] decided to implement compile-time mini-language inside menu converter ;)
  (in order to address the needs of new increasingly complex menus)
  so it was programmed but not tested at all, this will be fun to debug :P
18.02.2019.
- [mnu2h] been debugging preproc parser, will need to add some changes to the scanner in order for everything to work
19.02.2019.
- [mnu2h] changes in effect, parser debugged and working beautifully, C expressions are now available :)
- [mnu2h] implemented quoting in strings ("thi\"s\"" and 'this\'s\'')
- [mnu2h] extended preprocessor expressions to use all kinds of variables, and fixed bunch of small bugs
  (now just gotta implement repeat loops properly, with expression re-evaluation)
20.02.2019.
- worked on evaluation tree generation as a result of parsing so true loops can be implemented (and conditional
  statements later if/when required)
21.02.2019.
- separated evaluation from parsing, so now the field is ready for proper repeat loop implementation (still have to
  figure out constant expression folding, although it's not too difficult)
22.02.2019.
- almost debugged repeat loop implementation (nested loops still not working properly)
23.02.2019.
- debugging loops, seems the problem is more involved
24.02.2019.
- some invalid tokens are in the stream, seems tokens weren't copied by value (by reference) and got modified, but
  didn't manage to fix it
25.02.2019.
- finally fixed nested loops :)
- linted mnu2h Python code, that didn't go too bad

- looked around re-establishing select files menu
07.03.2019.
- some small advancement, wrote machine-independent findFiles()
08.03.2019.
- dabbling a bit with replacements for GetFilenameAndExtension() and SelectFileToSaveDialog(), will need a way to
  return int from imported function (since just setting eax doesn't work with void function, compiler is adding
  some destructor and what not)
09.03.2019.
- had to modify import function specification so that I could specify that function returns an int, writing a
  linear memory storage vector-like template to hold imports
10.03.2019.
- trying to fix a problem with custom iterator dereference operator
11.03.2019.
- silly me, it was simple, I was returning value instead of reference, now everything is all right
- implemented function that returns zero flag clear/set (had to use declspec naked), so the temporary problem is
  solved, we're back in the saddle ;)
12.03.2019.

- finally managed to do some significant work, continued with mnu2h refactoring, extracted tokenizer from parser,
  and currently breaking up those awful long parser methods, making them much shorter and sweeter
19.04.2019.
- continued working on refactoring, had solid progress
20.04.2019.
- menu and entry parsing is refactored (Uncle Bob would be proud ;)), now working on code generator
- code generation has been extracted from parser
- it turned out that due to a bug the refactored code didn't run at all, and there were plenty more bugs :)
  nevertheless, a lot has been done and it seems I will be able to extract preprocessor after all, so that's some
  good news, but too tired to do it now :)
21.04.2019.
- set up Python tests with coverage reporting
- covered Tokenizer completely! (except for __repr__ and one line I think can never be reached :))
22.04.2019.
- upgraded mnu2h into its own project with separate dir (it earned it well ;))
- started covering parser (it's gonna be a rough ride ;)) and fixed some minor bugs in tokenizer
- got parser coverage up to 46%
23.04.2019.
- got parser coverage up to 72%
- extraction of preprocessor and test coverage in progress, it is currently at 27%
24.04.2019.
- doing a big redesign of the way tokens are handled through the parser (I think this implicit structure that kind
  of grew on its own is invalid, as each function returning the token that follows it doesn't allow for entities at
  the end of the file, + I have much better error handling as it is known in advance which tokens are searched for
  (since we do it now from the handling function, and not the previous one which has no clue about what's coming))
25.04.2019.
- big redesign done! finished with negative test and that's a huge milestone, coverage is up at 83% for parser and
  71% for preprocessor, which is about the max before positive tests
- fixed many smaller bugs
- started implementing positive tests, added tests for parser warnings and preprocessor expressions;
  raised coverage to 87% parser, 82% preprocessor (winning these high percentages is harder than it seems!)
- I better go to sleep soon or I feel I might faint :P
26.04.2019.
- fixing and refactoring repeat directive
- extracting preproc expressions into a class of its own
- extracting variable handling into a class of its own
27.04.2019.
- fixed all tests except #repeat
- all the tests are passing after the refactor!
- added text measurement test
- coverage: Parser 89%, PreprocExpression 97%, Preprocessor 99% (!), Tokenizer 95%, Util 86%, VariableStorage 92%
- this is getting near the end, gotta add some additional tests here and there and to write code generator tests
28.04.2019.
- added line number checks to error message tests
- fixed bug handling raw (~) functions
- fixed bug handling single quoted string in string tables
- added tests for all kinds of variables
- fixed a few bugs
- added two new directives: #warningsOn and #warningsOff, mainly for tests ;) but it could prove useful on its own
- learned I can access static method through self reference, oops :)
- added tests for entry properties
- did a pylint run, looking good
- added crazy hybrid evaluation of preprocessor and standard variables (whatever can be parsed by the preprocessor
  expression parser will be evaluated as integer)
29.04.2019.
- fixed a little bug with tokenizer warnings off directive
- implementing many of code generator tests
- #join() can now be used within expressions
- forgot to test string escapes, fixed
- woops, seems a preprocessor expression inside a loop containing a mix of constants and variables is broken
30.04.2019.
- doh, preprocessor is PURRfect, I put the wrong variable in the test (idiot!)
- allowed #join to join itself recursively, pretty cool huh :)
- added integer format specification as in Python (actually just forwarding it to Python :))
- improved tests a bit
01.05.2019.
- added verify C++ keyword test
- covered dynamic menu variables (prev. x/y etc.)
- fixed some problems with internal variables expansion
- added some awesomeness in the form of string indexing operator as well as ability to invoke basic string editing
  functions on constant string (and the parameters can be preproc expressions!)
02.05.2019.
- added tests for included files (and fixed a bug there)
- added tests for string tables
03.05.2019.
- improved parsing of delayed expansion properties
- fixed negative number parsing
- fixed error in rotation routines
- added Util tests
- coverage: Parser 99%, Preprocessor 100% (!), Util 100%, only CodeGenerator left (81%)
04.05.2019.
- fixed error in function parameters
- added test for preprocessor in all contexts
05.05.2019.
- added tests for menu index assignment and exported variables to code generator tests
06.05.2019.
- adding final code generator tests
- fixed a bug in the parser (when assigning default entry values)
- fixed a bug in the code generator, it was needlessly outputting entry for default color
- fixed a bug where ResetTemplateEntry wasn't outputted
- fixed a minor bug with settings entry directions
- overall coverage is at 99%! my job here is done :)
07.05.2019.
- fixed a small bug when assigning entry property values from other entry properties
08.05.2019.
- and the build is running again! (although I'm not satisfied with it -- VS build system just sucks big time)
- started extraction of comments.cpp from audio.cpp
09.05.2019.
/
10.05.2019.
- refactoring comments but it seems to be much more complicated than I thought...
11.05.2019.
- refactoring audio stuff is nasty, but at least it's coming along
12.05.2019.
- finished audio refactoring, took longer than expected, but it looks good, and seems I didn't break anything :)
  (but who knows :)); also found and removed an unused variable (it seemed to have been there for quite a while)
13.05.2019.
- [mnu2h] report an error when an entry has zero width/height (so we can catch it before compiling C++ code)
14.05.2019.

15.05.2019.

16.05.2019.

08.06.2019.
- SDL hooking test passed with flying colors!! :)

11.06.2019.
- integrated tests into main project (will need to use asm files)
12.06.2019.
- trying to compile tests which use basically all stuff as the main project, but currently failing
13.06.2019.
- fixing all the link errors since some files are missing from the main project
14.06.2019.
- tests finally compile and link!
15.06.2019.
- realized I didn't need render.cpp (it's all SDL interface to "VGA" buffer)
16.06.2019.
- setting up base test structure... still struggling :)
- need to include generated menu header in order to access menu constants... but there are also static functions in
  there that get declared, so added them as stubs in header, under conditional SWOS_TEST but now it fails since I got
  menus in tests that are supposed to be compiled normally... ugh
17.06.2019.
/
18.06.2019.
- [mnu2h] updated tests with #ifdef for testing stubs
19.06.2019.
- worked a bit on it, fixed creating a library when compiling tests
20.06.2019.
- dabbled a bit
21.06.2019.
/
22.06.2019.
- executed first hello world unit test, very primitive, but it ran :)
23.06.2019.
- finally set up SWOS environment in tests :)
- [mnu2h] declared string tables as static (that was discovered when including the file twice for the tests)
24.06.2019.
- fixed commentary loading that I completely broke :/ I really have to get these things covered with unit tests...
- tried to compile with C++17 since I upgraded to Visual Studio 2019, but if I do that I lose capability to compile
  for Windows XP.. @#$&$!^ (plus SimpleIni breaks... sheesh)
- [mnu2h] fixed nasty bug with string tables: I forgot to #pragma pack them! added test for this as well
- finally managed to render a single menu frame for tests... I think :D
25.06.2019.
- had nice progress with unit tests, now actually writing one for video options menu, will see how it goes ;)
- [mnu2h] fixed minor formatting issues, extraneous new lines
26.06.2019.
- finally got the error reporting the way I like it, and failed assertion exception hierarchy took shape
- civilized SDL faker a bit, now need to fill in more stuff and create a good test for video options
27.06.2019.
- fixed a bug in loadFile when using offset parameter
- refactored duplicated code in video options menu
- implemented screenshot grabbing in tests (damn useful it is!)
- writing tests, but it's not going the way I planned
28.06.2019.
- writing video options resolutions test
- removed resolution limiting from video options (any resolution will be now displayed in the menu, not sure if
  that's smart, remains to be seen)
29.06.2019.
- fixed few bugs in tests and finally incomplete tests are passing
- lookie, lookie, VS static analysis actually caught a bug in menus, whaddya know...
- updated SimpleIni, and I can compile with C++17 now MUAHAHAHA (at least the tests, they don't need Windows XP ;))
- implemented tester command line parameters
- started implementing window mode tests
30.06.2019.
- implemented video options menu mode switching test
- fixed slight mis-positions of the items (by a pixel or two)
01.07.2019.
- added timeout detection to tests, if any case gets into infinite loop tester will detect it, report it and exit
02.07.2019.
- fixed nasty bug with tester error reporting, took a reference to a non-const object returned from a function
- implemented custom width/height input test
03.07.2019.
- sorted video resolution list by highest first, makes more sense to prefer the best resolutions system can handle
- handled the case when we can't go full-screen (resolution list empty) (UT's already showing their value)
- recolored items in video options menu (didn't like the gray on inactive items, it looked like they can't be
  selected anymore)
04.07.2019.
/
05.07.2019.
- implemented list scrolling test
- added exit button test
- implemented test for resolution change failure
06.07.2019.
- fixed a small bug with resolution list where the current resolution would stay marked even in windowed mode
- video options menu tests are DONE!!! hellz yeah!!!
- [mnu2h] added tests for string manipulation routines
- finally pushed code to the repository today, haven't done that in a looong time
- fixed clumsy report output in tester with multiple tests
07.07.2019.
- fixed crash when opening edit tactics menu

- wrote fake file system for testing ;)
13.07.2019.
- debugged fake file system and sound samples loading
14.07.2019.
- some more stuff done on commentary tests
15.07.2019.
- and here the value of tests show: I actually swapped foul & dirty tackle comments; stuff like this is really hard
  to catch by testing alone
16.07.2019.
- again the power of testzs: bar hit comment was wrong, reusing last comment from post hit and not using its last
  comment at all
- found that keeper claimed has one mute comment (length of sample is 0, I assume AIL will ignore but it still goes
  through normal comment procedure, so it's a valid silent comment), chance of playing is 12.5%
- fixed some errors in sound.txt
- fixed invalid penalty saved comment table
- so much invalid stuff in the comments, will check it thoroughly tomorrow
17.07.2019.
- fixed yet ANOTHER bug with double chance sample assignment.... ><
- worked on wrapping up original comments tests but didn't managed to finish
18.07.2019.
- finished all the testing for original comments except for a few complicated routines, leaving those for later
19.07.2019.

20.07.2019.

  identical content (actually one file with different filenames), game will hang when trying to play comment from
  this category

  restrict them to absolutely essential stuff and TDD
03.08.2019.
/
04.08.2019.
- [ida2asm] line number bug that is tormenting me for a long time was at least partially amended, but still not
  fixed completely :(
05.08.2019.
- [ida2asm] fixed a bug when remove block goes to the file end, EOF token is returned from the parseProc(), but new
  line is expected, resulting in parse error; solved by injecting new line token to the end of each division end if
  it wasn't already there
- [ida2asm] fixed a bug when proc hook was placed on a label; it was checked only in instruction, now it's checked
  when label is encountered as well, notice that it could still be skipped if it's placed on a comment line but I'd
  rather not check it for every comment in the file
- fixed a crash in a CPU vs CPU game with at least 1 top goalkeeper (discovered by starwindz)
06.08.2019.
- haven't done much, but finally settling on select files menu recreation (with test ready to debug it once it's
  (nearly) done)
07.08.2019.

08.08.2019.

10.08.2019.

11.08.2019.

12.08.2019.
- [ida2asm] added parsing error for unknown directive, it was unhandled before but starwindz was modifying swos.asm
  directly and entered something unsupported
- [mnu2h] added special variable to reference previous entry ordinal
- bit of progress in select files menu (actually wanted to fix career crash but can't load career without this
  menu :D)

18.08.2019.
- fighting with select files menu, it's as nothing is working properly
19.08.2019.
- so a hilarious thing happened, suddenly debug tests got really really slow... up to a point they couldn't be run
  in entirety; timeout check wasn't triggering so it wasn't an endless loop, it was just slow; upgraded Visual
  Studio, rebooted the computer... slow again!! OK, I fire up the profiler, it finishes in <50ms (debug version)!!!
  run debug version => dog slow... I am pissed now, WTF is going on and how will I even debug this nightmare...
  luckily, in a flash of inspiration data breakpoint comes to mind, and I check, yes! here it is! little mother
  @#$%@# :D deleted it and it's all good again :)
- didn't progress much but at least cleared up the mess a bit

15.09.2019.
- misread spriteGraphicsPtr type :facepalm, it's actually a pointer to array of pointers to Sprite graphics, updated
  SymbolFileParser accordingly
- made a good quality string elision routine, since I have a feeling this isn't the last we'll see of it, but some
  tests are still failing
16.09.2019.

- [mnu2h] fixed template entry values being ignored under certain conditions
- found that the colors are broken in controls menu, but no time now to fix them...
21.09.2019.
- fixed missing background colors in controls menu, entry background type wasn't set (it was set to default
  0 = none), no idea how that worked before
- thought there was a bug in handling expressions inside mnu2h #repeat's but it's just me failing basic matrix math
- [mnu2h] fixed duplication of fields from template entry
- [mnu2h] fixed a small bug with evaluation of entry ordinals involving expressions
- set up navigation in select files menu, however something might be buggy around moving through disabled item
  field, too tired to handle now
22.09.2019.
- ha, it wasn't a bug with moving through items, it's that I used next disabled entry to the left field as custom
  user fields for storing file indices to associate entries with filenames... sucks that entries lack user field,
  but fixed it now and it works like a charm :)
- loading files finally works again :) (with same old limitations but we'll get to that ;))
23.09.2019.
- got kinda close to making save work, but something's wrong with competitions (I get wrong name after loading them)
24.09.2019.
- fixed default menu entry in quit menu to be return to the game
- fixed crash when aborting save (returned string could be nullptr, d-oh!)
- fixed a small bug with string elision
- aaand the save is finally working! :) as for the competitions nothing was wrong, their funny names confused me :)
- added scrolling but arrows aren't reachable yet so gotta solve that first
25.09.2019.
- scrolling arrows are now reachable and the scrolling works just perfect :)
- added a feature to menu system which enables menus to register a "global mouse wheel entires", a pair of entries
  which get triggered whenever the wheel is scrolled up/down; it works globally, simplifies things a lot and is
  pretty cool, for now using it in select files and video options menus
- fixed single column with long filenames sticking to the right (since there's only 2 columns it can only pick
  leftmost or rightmost)
- wrote initial version of build description document
26.09.2019.
- did something but fell asleep and now can't remember what it was
27.09.2019.
- did some nice refactoring
- writing tests for select files menu, and caught one bug! even being boring to exhaustion and slow to write, tests
  are a really great asset
28.09.2019.
- adapted C++ style guide to use with the SWOS port
- wrote bulk of initial version of ida2asm documentation
29.09.2019.
- finished entry transition test for select files menu and fixed bugs found during the writing
- added abort button press test for select files menu
30.09.2019.
- worked on selecting file test in select files menu
01.10.2019.
- finish() hook in tests wasn't called at all, whoops!
- fixed yellow "please wait" test in video options menu
- finished selecting file test in select files menu and fixed some bugs that were discovered
02.10.2019.
- implementing scrolling files test
03.10.2019.
- finished scrolling files test, now debugging it, but it's still not working properly
04.10.2019.
- scrolling files test is passing! :)
- load competition test is passing as well!
- spotted a bug, loaded highlight name gets forgotten upon reentering the menu
05.10.2019.
- fixed yesterday's bug and added a test case, easy peasy
- fixed top scroll arrow overlapping with files if it's a full list with in a save dialog
- some tests are failing in release mode :O and they are flaky no less -_-
    edit: EditTactis() needed a safe call macro, but it somehow worked in debug version,
    and the flakiness came from returning address of local TeamGeneralInfo variable, IDIOT :S
    can't believe there was no warning about this, maybe because I was assigning it to a Register class and
    its voodoo template magic mesmerized the compiler
- [tests] added assert when warning or error are logged (can be turned off), it's too dangerous when those
    things go unnoticed
- [tests] fixed not reporting case name of the test that failed
- [tests] fixed some hideous examples of illiteracy
- [tests] fixed names of bitmap screenshots (much nicer now)
- fixed wrongly matching file extension if first 3 characters match (but not the rest) & wrote a test for it
06.10.2019.
- refactored mouse handler in menus into its own module
- sped up scrolling when arrow is clicked and mouse button held; while doing it found out that menu entry
  functions were getting called without safe call, preservation of 68k registers and setting A5 to entry
  pointer... yikes, how did that even work so far
07.10.2019.
- [mnu2h] fixed unary +/- applied to a variable
- finished initial version of ida2asm document
- strange, I'm getting some test failures after a reboot, there could be some timing problems
08.10.2019.
- fixed tests, luckily there were no timing problems, just a side effect of new speed scrolling on click
09.10.2019.
- fixed menu glitch (it was a small error in refactoring)
- disabled in-game animations (all of them, I hope)
10.10.2019.
- tried to improve ida2asm to support remove ranges split in different files, but didn't manage to finish it
  even after a furious struggle
11.10.2019.
/

- finally made it work, now I can specify unbroken remove segments and it will be processed automagically,
  no more need to waste time on that (and in doing that switched to thread pool and removed a case of false
  sharing, I may have shaved a few ms off the running time :P)
13.10.2019.
- [ida2asm] started adding support for unlimited proc hooks, more than half is implemented I'd say
14.10.2019.
- [ida2asm] pretty good progress on unlimited proc hooks, was hoping to wrap it up today, but unfortunately
  got some other things to attend to, hopefully tomorrow is the day
15.10.2019.
- [ida2asm] unlimited proc hooks done! tested it, and it works very well + custom names for hooks are really
  great, finally renamed those awful mnemonic names into something more meaningful; will write the
  documentation and publish it tomorrow
- [ida2asm] unfortunately realized that false sharing isn't properly fixed, well, another thing for tomorrow
16.10.2019.

17.10.2019.
- [ida2asm] finally fixed the damn false sharing... it was pretty hard, as it involved fixing class design
  and a lot of pointer arithmetics... but it was fun :)
18.10.2019.
- converted sprite drawing routine to C++ after a long struggle... SWPE was a huge help at this
19.10.2019.
- bench routines seem to use sprite drawing routines of their own, at first I tried to convert them but that
  proved to be a too massive step, so I will keep some temporary code to route their sprite draw into the new
  routine that I wrote until it's all nicely converted and cleaned up
- need to research this a bit more, and find precise connections between 320 -> 336 -> 384

- started reconstructing highlights menu
23.10.2019.
- fixed menu mouse selection being able to select disabled items
- fixed highlights not exiting on fire
- fixed saving highlights file with double extension if selecting a filename from the list
- reimplemented highlights saving
24.10.2019.
- fixed tests broken yesterday
- covered saving file by selecting file from file list with tests; I want to emphasize once again how gross
  patching the global load file routine is to save selected files pointer
25.10.2019.
- reimplemented SaveCoordinatesForHighlights and hooked it up with replay vector, but haven't tested it yet
26.10.2019.
- fixed rerouted replay, but getting reminded now of how replays work, it's not as simple as I initially
  thought, will need to reorganize it a bit
27.10.2019.
- implemented replay scheme, it's not really working yet, but felt like in good old SWOS++ days there for a
  moment ;)
28.10.2019.
- added auto save replays option
29.10.2019.
- implemented actual auto-saving the current replay file
- and the replays are finally working!! :) still need to test a few more edge cases, but it's looking good
30.10.2019.
- fixed invalid filename for auto saved replay file, and not saving it in binary mode (oops!)
- fixed invalid logic when aborting load/save
- saved replays seem to be corrupted :/
31.10.2019.
- refactored replays file, fixed some mistakes and finally fixed the corruption bug; but auto saved replay
  isn't saved properly when game is exited with alt-F1, that's left for tomorrow, too tired now
01.11.2019.
- auto saved replay wasn't corrupted on alt-F1 :) I broke playing replays when fixing the bench replay
  corruption bug; it's too difficult determining dynamically the point of call of InitCurrentGoal(), so I
  just added a way to remove lines to ida2asm, and removed it directly from BenchCheckControls()
- [ida2asm] fixed parsing error when hook proc was empty (but leading comma was present)
- [ida2asm] added support for removing lines, by inserting special hook name "@remove"
- added capturing in-game screenshots on F2 (file format PNG)
- in case user-assigned key conflicts with some game function key, game function key will not be doing this
  function anymore
- added fast replays/highlights mode, can be toggled via 'F'
- debug variables can be toggled via 'D'
- fixed trying to auto-save a replay if alt-F1 is pressed while watching highlights
- improved replay menu navigation when there are disabled items
- prevented menu item initially under mouse arrow getting selected (I don't like that)
02.11.2019.
- [ida2asm] handled properly cases where start/end removal range symbols are missing (e.g. they got renamed)
- bah, just realized pressing 'R' during the game messes up replay (cuts it off at the first press)
- blocked recording while in substitutes (like SWOS++)
03.11.2019.
- [ida2asm] fixed reporting same unused symbol multiple times
- transfered useful part of docs from SWOS++, now on they will be kept in this repository
- debugged 'R' killing replay problem but no success
04.11.2019.
- moved replays to its own "replays" dir, should probably do that for other types as well later
- still no solution to the replay bug, what could be so different in playback?
05.11.2019.
- [ida2asm] fixed nasty and subtle memory overwrite bug in StringMap, didn't allocate 1 more byte for the end
  sentinel node string content
- changed "REPLAY" text after friendly game to "PLAY AGAIN" (I think it was confusing considering the usage
  of term "replay" for watching saved games)
- oof, fixed at least a part of the replay bug, so a short replay with 1 'R' works now, but the longer one
  with more doesn't
- omg, FINALLY fixed the damn thing; if 'R' is pressed during the game, game switches into instant-replay
  mode, it will replay whatever is in the current hil buffer and will inevitably overflow the buffer (if not
  interrupted), and our poor class will think the buffer was filled with new data and will save entire
  contents to replay, which is a double problem: not only will it save unnecessary repeated recording, it
  will also pick up -1 marker from the buffer (left by the last saved coordinate), and that will make the
  recording later stop at that point when replayed; so I think it's fixed now, only thing that concerns me
  a bit is that I managed to get a crash once when pressing 'R' near the beginning of the game: currentHilPtr
  was null which could only mean that RestoreHighlightPointers() was called without calling
  SaveHighlightPointers() first, which could happen in case numReplaysInHilFile was 0, which I have no idea
  why would be 0...) but I never managed to reproduce it so it might have been something temporary; will
  maybe try some more later... pheww.....
06.11.2019.
- fixed glitch that was preventing startup in release mode (failing to read one.256)
- "please wait" text when enumerating video modes will now only appear if it takes longer than 333ms
- hid mouse cursor when playing the game full screen
- fixed crash at the start of the game, not sure if it's the same thing as yesterday, this was when the
  sound was off but StopAudio() was called which called Mix_HaltChannel and apparently SDL_mixer doesn't
  like that when it's not initialized
- fixed text alignment in video options menu
- added pause at stadium loading screen (can be disabled via command line)
07.11.2019.
- working on converting UpdateTime
08.11.2019.
- -//-
09.11.2019.
- -//-
10.11.2019.
- finally finished converting UpdateTime! it took longer than expected, in the future conversions like this
  should best be avoided (even though it is the ultimate goal, but it's just so error prone that it
  shouldn't go into any build that has to be bug free)
- making two screenshots in succession (same second) would result in 2nd overwriting 1st; added milliseconds
  to the filename to fix that (if you do make two in the same millisecond you're out of luck)
11.11.2019.
- not much, but explored the idea of C output writer, and wrote some skeleton files
12.11.2019.
/
13.11.2019.
- generated struct & define file in C ;) some stuff is hard-coded assuming ASM file will be generated, so
  fixing that is gonna be the next goal
14.11.2019.
- fixed ASM assumption stuff, started crunching the instructions, finished push/pop instructions
15.11.2019.
- suddenly started getting some garbage in tokens in ida2asm, thought it's some new gruesome bug, but it
  turned out that IDA 7.0 (to which I upgraded ;)) adds BOM to exported ASM
- new IDA adds Unicode symbols for up/down arrows, copied those into output, it's looking nicer now ;)
- implemented cbw/cwde/conditional jumps
- need to figure out a good way to fetch operands generically for all instructions, it would make things lot
  easier afterwards
16.11.2019.
- still fighting with mov instruction, it's quite nasty
- added original instruction as a comment, it's pretty useful for debugging
17.11.2019.
- testing initial decomposition of instruction parameters (addressing modes & stuff),
- extended tokenizer to recognize parentheses as delimiters, to avoid "(offset" ending up as one token
  (thank goodness for tests, otherwise I don't think it would be possible); comparing generated assembly,
  seems the same, hope it didn't break anything :)
- phew, 1st phase of parameter parsing is OK, source and destination are extracted, now to generate C code
  properly out of those data
18.11.2019.
- some very nice progress! mov instruction seems to be outputting just fine, and added an OR instruction
  output together with setting flags
19.11.2019.
- found out that instruction operand sizes haven't been set correctly in some cases, they weren't used much
  before (or at all) so it slipped through the cracks; fixing it as we go
- working on making CMP instruction reality, detecting flag conditions was annoying but I think I got it
20.11.2019.
- handled global level instructions - have put them into automatically generated function (with name
  containing auto incrementing integer)
- handled lookup of variable size (needed for cases like: cmp g_gameType, 4), also added lookup when structs
  are used without size prefix (e.g. cmp [esi+MenuEntry.entryType2], NO_FOREGROUND)
- CMP is almost there! (+ refactored and fixed bunch of stuff that lead to it)
- CMP done! + did a bunch of small things
21.11.2019.
- implemented INC, AND, XCHG, SUB, ADD
- now new line is properly inserted after a label, but not if it's already there (say from goto)
22.11.2019.
- implemented MUL, DEC, MOVZX
23.11.2019.
- implemented DIV, TEST, JNB
24.11.2019.
/
25.11.2019.
- implemented JA, SHL
26.11.2019.
- implemented SHR, XOR

- implemented rotate instructions, INT, NEG, LOOP, MOVSX, JL, JLE, IMUL
- oops, it seems that loop wasn't flagged as a branch instruction in the tokens list
05.12.2019.
- implemented IDIV, PUSHA, SAR, MOVSD, CDQ, NOT, POPA, MOVSB, OUT, STOSB/D, STC, CLC, IN, CLI, STI, POPF,
  CLD, SETZ, STOSW, MOVSW, probably missed some...
- but finally all the instructions are handled!!
07.12.2019.
- got some initial version of data output, but it's probably lacking badly
- trying to compile, but there are a lot of errors, fixing
- currently ran into a problem with accessing labels before the definition point
08.12.2019.
- did an extra first pass and forward declared all the data and functions and also fixed a bunch of
  compiling errors
09.12.2019.
- classified labels properly, no more errors there, fixed bunch of other compiling errors, error count is now
  at 20-30ish with only 2 knows cases to fix (albeit a bit tricky)
- I slipped with failing to mark some static buffers used by multiple threads as thread local, and was
  getting weird random null bytes in output, but always at numeric offsets converted from struct fields,
  it looked pretty funny ;)
10.12.2019.
- implemented horrible hack for switch in ConvertMenu, I simply didn't see any other way that wouldn't
  include extremely time consuming implementation of flow analysis (let's not go there)
- fixed bad generated code for add/sub/cmp
- fixed bunch of small issues
- getting close to clean compile, but still there are some errors to fix
11.12.2019.
- fixed a bunch of stuff... can't remember which... battery low... but the thing is not far from finish,
  I see the same errors related to struct access that plagued assembly output writer as well
12.12.2019.
- out() wasn't outputting a number if it's a zero... what a shameful mistake all this time >_<
- fixed struct variables problem, another gross hack
- implemented local variables and fixed some more stuff I can't remember now
- errors shrank even more, really hoping to finish it tomorrow or the day after
13.12.2019.
- only one file left to clean... ONE... unless I die first
- and the damned C converter is finally done, 2.3k lines and about 4x the size of the ASM counterpart
- only one crash with changes this big... not bad ;)
