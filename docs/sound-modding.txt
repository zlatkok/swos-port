When loading sound files the game will first look for "audio" directory. If
it's found it is assumed that all the audio files are stored there.

Commentary is expected to be under "audio\commentary". Inside this subdirectory
following directories are scanned for audio files:
    corner
    dirty_tackle
    end_game_rout
    end_game_sensational
    end_game_so_close
    free_kick
    goal
    good_play
    good_tackle
    header
    hit_bar
    hit_post
    injury
    keeper_claimed
    keeper_saved
    near_miss
    own_goal
    penalty
    penalty_missed
    penalty_scored
    penalty_saved
    red_card
    substitution
    tactic_changed
    throw_in
    yellow_card

Each directory should contain audio files for its category. All the audio files
under directory category are loaded, and when the event in the game happens one
of them is played randomly. If a directory is empty or missing, no comments
will be played in that category.

Supported audio extensions are: "raw", "mp3", "wav", "ogg", "flac". Raw files
are assumed to be 22kHz, mono (with the exception of "endgame.raw" and
"foul.raw", which are assumed to be 11kHz, mono).

Chances of playing individual files can be affected with special naming
convention:
    <file name>-x<number> or _x<number>

For example, a directory may contain 4 files:
    A.mp3, B.mp3, C.mp3, D.mp3

Chance of playing each file 25%. But suppose it contains following files:
    A_x2.mp3, B.mp3, C.mp3

In this case comment A will have 50% chance of getting played, while B and C
will have 25%.

Sound effects are searched for in directory "audio/fx", and should have
original SWOS filenames, although all supported file extensions may be used.
(e.g. "missgoal.mp3" will be used if "missgoal.raw" is missing)

If "audio" directory is not present, an attempt to load audio files having
structure as on SWOS CD will be made from the local game directory (assumption
is they're copied there). If that fails, game will run without sound.
